# Forge

**Forge gives you, on day one, the system most teams don't finish building
until year two** — a dev environment that comes up with one command and real
data in it, tracing and metrics on every boundary, multiple deploy
environments, secrets that never land in git, errors that can't leak your
database password to a stranger, and linters that catch the bugs review
doesn't.

It generates Go and Next.js wired over [Connect RPC](https://connectrpc.com),
and it deploys anything — including code it never compiled.

That second half matters more than it sounds, so it's worth saying plainly up
front: Forge has opinions, and none of them are walls. It ships an ORM you can
drop out of, a middleware chain in a file you own, and a Kubernetes deploy path
that will just as happily run your `fly deploy`. Our own control plane builds
three services out of a **separate repository** that Forge never compiles.

## Why teams pick it up

Every project eventually pays for the same plumbing: observability, a staging
environment, deploy promotion, secret management, a dev setup a new hire can
actually run. Teams almost never build that at the start — there's a product to
ship — so they build it in year two, under deadline, on top of a codebase that
wasn't shaped for it. That's a rewrite nobody enjoys and everybody schedules
twice.

Forge's pitch is that you skip that quarter. The first commit already has the
things that rewrite would have added, wired into files you own and can change.

The second reason is newer. When an agent writes most of the code, the
bottleneck stops being how fast you can write it and becomes **knowing whether
it's right**. So Forge optimizes for something narrower than productivity: it
makes a project legible to whoever works on it next, human or model. Every
boundary is instrumented, every convention is enforced by a linter, every
generated file knows whether you edited it, and the binary can describe its own
surface on demand.

And several of the defaults exist because the unsafe version caused a real
incident — not because a style guide recommended them:

- **An error message once shipped a database password** to an unauthenticated
  caller. `connect.Error.Message()` is literally `err.Error()`, so any error
  text you didn't write is text you publish. Now `svcerr.Wrap` replaces
  unrecognized errors with `internal server error` and keeps the original
  server-side.
- **Images built on an arm64 laptop once got pushed to amd64 nodes.** Now cloud
  targets require an explicit `platform`, and it fails at author time.
- **Replicas once half-migrated a schema.** Now migrations apply from an
  initContainer under a Postgres advisory lock, and a failed one stalls the
  rollout with the old pods still serving.

## The first sixty seconds

```bash
forge project new my-app && cd my-app
forge scaffold service billing
forge generate
forge run
```

That last command brings up your services and frontends, and — on a fresh
database — **seeds it with realistic, foreign-key-coherent data introspected
from your own schema**, so the app boots alive instead of booting empty. You
get back a table of URLs: the app, the frontend, Grafana, and a per-service log
file for each process.

No signup, no external accounts, no cloud project, no cluster.

## 1. Production best practices from day 0

The first commit already has the things teams usually bolt on in year two.
A scaffolded service boots with structured logging, tracing, metrics, panic
recovery, request IDs, health and readiness probes, graceful shutdown, and
payload caps — all wired in a `serve.go` **you own** and can reorder.

The defaults are chosen to fail safe:

- **Errors don't leak.** `svcerr.Wrap` replaces unrecognized errors with
  `internal server error` and keeps the original server-side, so error text you
  didn't write is never text you publish.
- **Auth fails closed.** A production server refuses to boot with no auth
  provider configured, at construction time rather than on first request.
  JWT with OIDC discovery is the default; Clerk and Firebase are variants, API
  keys are a first-class credential, and a local dev IdP gives you a real
  browser sign-in with one command.
- **Unsafe migrations are caught before they run**, not after they lock a table
  in production — see [bug-class linting](#linting-for-bug-classes-not-just-style).
- **You can't deploy the wrong env to the wrong cluster.** The kubectl context
  is read solely from the environment's KCL. There is no CLI override and no
  fallback to your current context.
- **Secrets stay out of rendered output.** Declare a secret once as a
  reference and bind it per-environment through a provider. Forge refuses to
  render plaintext Secrets into anything but a recognized local cluster.
  `sensitive` config fields get no slot in git to paste a password into and no
  CLI flag to leak one into shell history.

### What "secure by default" does and doesn't mean here

Two different things ship under that heading, and they're worth separating,
because one is load-bearing and one is a starting point.

**The runtime posture above is real and tested** — it's the core of Forge, it's
covered by the same gates as everything else, and it's what stops the incidents
in the list above from recurring.

**The scanning is generated into your CI, and it's yours to verify.** A new
project gets a `ci.yml` that runs `govulncheck` and `npm audit` through
`forge ci vuln-scan` — a gate built to refuse a pass it didn't actually verify,
so a missing scanner fails the job instead of exiting green over an empty scan.
Container images get Trivy scans that block on HIGH/CRITICAL, and pushed images
get an SPDX SBOM, a keyless cosign signature, and a build-provenance
attestation, all bound to the immutable digest rather than a mutable tag.
Dependabot ships too.

What is **not** there today: secret scanning, SAST, IaC/manifest scanning, and
license compliance. And the generated workflows are among the less-exercised
surfaces in Forge — treat them as a strong default to review and adapt, not as
a compliance story you can point an auditor at. `forge lint` itself does no
security scanning at all; it enforces architecture and migration safety.

### Multiple environments on day 0, not month six

Environments are not a thing you graduate to. A new project declares them as
KCL under `deploy/kcl/<env>/`, and the same source renders dev, staging, and
prod. Our own control plane runs `dev`, `dev-k8s`, `e2e`, `staging`, `preprod`,
and `prod` across k3d, Vultr, and two GKE clusters, from one definition.

- **Build once, promote by digest.** `forge build --release v1.4.0` captures
  content-addressed digests; `forge env promote v1.4.0 --to prod` ships the
  exact bytes that passed staging.
- **Preflight before apply.** On remote clusters, Forge verifies every
  referenced Secret key and every image against the live target and reports
  all failures up front, rather than discovering them as a mid-rollout
  `ImagePullBackOff`.
- **Failures move to author time.** KCL schemas validate at load. The guard
  requiring an explicit `platform` on cloud targets exists because building
  from an arm64 laptop once pushed images that wouldn't run on amd64 nodes.
- **Config is typed and declared once.** Annotate a proto field; get env-var
  loading with precedence, a KCL schema, per-environment values, and — for
  `sensitive` fields — a secret reference with no slot in git to paste a
  password into and no CLI flag to leak one into shell history.

---

## 2. A dev environment that actually comes up

The most expensive document at most companies is the onboarding doc that is
wrong in two places. Forge's answer is that there isn't one: the environment is
declared in the same KCL that renders staging and prod, so "how do I run this"
has a command instead of a wiki page.

- **One command, whole stack.** `forge run` starts every host service and
  frontend with no cluster involved. `forge env up dev` does the full loop —
  build, deploy, host, frontend.
- **The database is not empty.** On first boot against a dev env, Forge seeds
  deterministic, foreign-key-coherent data **introspected from your applied
  schema**, in one transaction, only when every seedable table is empty.
  Synthesized values satisfy your CHECK constraints, length caps, and UNIQUE
  columns by construction. No seed files land in your repo.
- **Full observability locally.** The Grafana LGTM stack — Grafana, Prometheus,
  Tempo, Loki, Pyroscope — runs in Docker Compose with dashboards already
  provisioned. No accounts, no signup, no sampling surprises.
- **Ten checkouts don't collide.** Each git worktree gets its own stable
  100-port block through a lock-guarded registry, so parallel stacks (or
  parallel agents) coexist. `forge env ps` lists every Forge stack on the
  machine, across projects.
- **Nothing hangs.** Without a TTY, `forge env up` starts everything, prints
  the summary, and returns — so CI and agents don't deadlock waiting on a
  foreground process.

The pitch in one line: a new engineer, or a new agent, gets the whole system
running with realistic data and end-to-end tracing before lunch on day one.

---

## 3. Feedback loops, so an agent can see what it built

Generation is the easy half. This is the half that decides whether a project
survives contact with six months of agent-authored changes.

### Predictability: one known place for everything

An LLM's failure mode isn't writing bad code — it's _guessing_. Guessing which
port the API bound, where the logs went, how to reach the database, whether the
thing it just changed is even running. Every guess is a plausible-looking
answer that might be wrong, and wrong answers compound silently.

Forge's structural advantage is that these questions all have a command, and
the command reads the same rendered KCL the running stack was built from — so
the answer can't drift from reality:

| The question                                      | The command                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What is running, on what port, and is it healthy? | `forge env status <env>` (`--json`)                           |
| Where are the logs for this service?              | `forge env status` — a log path per service                   |
| What are the ingress URLs?                        | `forge cluster urls` (`--json`)                               |
| What does the schema actually look like?          | `forge db introspect --dsn "$DATABASE_URL"` (`--format json`) |
| How do I call this RPC?                           | `forge api curl <service.method>`                             |
| What is this project, structurally?               | `forge project audit --json`, `map --json`                    |
| Is the project well-formed?                       | `forge doctor`                                                |
| What can Forge even do?                           | `forge project capabilities`, `annotations`, `libraries`      |

Two properties make this usable by a model rather than just available to one.
**Every answer is machine-readable**, so an agent parses instead of scraping
scrollback. And **the surface is enumerated from Forge's own command tree and
descriptors**, so it cannot drift the way a document can — the agent asks the
binary rather than trusting a stale README.

`forge env status` is the sharpest example. It reports the port a service bound
_right now_, which process holds it, whether that binary is **stale versus your
repo HEAD**, and a loud DUPLICATE flag when two vintages of the same service
are serving at once — the classic "hot reload spawned a new worker and didn't
reap the old one" failure that otherwise reads as "my fix didn't work."

### Observability you get without asking for it

Three boundaries are instrumented, so a request is traceable end to end:

1. **The RPC edge** — one span, metric, and log line per RPC.
2. **Every in-process component call** — the layer that is usually dark. Forge
   generates a per-method decorator from your `contract.go` interface, so
   adding a method instruments it automatically. There is nothing to maintain
   by hand and nothing to forget.
3. **Every database query** — a child span per query, via the ORM's bun hook.

Logs are structured JSON with stable keys (`procedure`, `request_id`,
`trace_id`, `duration_ms`, `status`, `code`), and the trace ID is injected into
every log line — so a log entry is one click from the trace that produced it.
The full Grafana LGTM stack (Grafana, Prometheus, Tempo, Loki, Pyroscope) runs
locally in Docker Compose with two dashboards provisioned. No external
accounts, no signup, no sampling surprises.

### Checks that refuse to lie to you

```bash
forge env status dev                  # everything runtime about an env
forge env status dev --signal traces  # or one signal at a time
forge env status dev --json           # machine-readable, for an agent
```

A check that cannot obtain the facts it needs reports **UNDETERMINED**, never a
pass and never a skip. Three outcomes, not two. This matters more than it
sounds: a false green is the single most expensive thing you can hand an agent,
because it will confidently build on top of it.

For the same reason, we'll tell you what these checks _don't_ cover. They
verify the telemetry pipeline is healthy — containers up, signals ingesting,
probes green. They do **not** certify your app logic is correct. A stack can be
fully green while a cross-cluster dial is failing. Proving an app-flow
invariant is what tests are for.

### Test seams that already exist

- **A mock for every interface**, generated from `contract.go`. An agent never
  hand-rolls a fake, and a contract change breaks the build _at the mock_
  rather than somewhere distant three files away.
- **A real Postgres, not a stub.** `pkg/pgtest` and `pkg/testkit` give
  hermetic tests an actual ephemeral database with your migrations applied.
- **Table-driven RPC tests** via `pkg/tdd`, so handler tests have one shape.
- **Scaffolded tests self-destruct.** A generated test row asserts
  `Unimplemented`, so it _fails the moment the handler is implemented_ —
  demanding a real assertion. There is no permissive "any outcome" mode.
- **Frontend mock scenarios.** `forge scaffold scenario` writes a typed
  Connect-RPC handler overlay you reach with `?scenario=<name>` in the URL —
  so an agent can teleport the UI into a specific server-state shape (an empty
  list, a revoked token, a failing payment) without touching the backend.
  Anything a scenario doesn't override falls through to the base transport.

### Two more that don't fit in a table

- **A real debugger.** `forge debug` drives Delve against a running service:
  breakpoints, step in/over/out, locals, args, stack, goroutines, and
  expression evaluation. An agent can inspect a live process rather than
  reasoning about one.
- **Errors are runbooks.** Failures state what was expected, what was found,
  and the literal command that fixes it — so a failure is an instruction to
  follow rather than a puzzle to solve. Commands are non-interactive and never
  hang without a TTY, so an agent can drive them unattended.

---

## 4. Guardrails, so the loop stays closed

Feedback is worthless if the code drifts faster than you can observe it.

- **`contract.go` is the seam.** Every internal package declares its interface,
  its `Deps` (interface-typed, enforced by lint), and its constructor.
- **Conventions are enforced, not suggested.** `forge lint` ships twenty-odd
  analyzers that catch what review usually misses: handlers doing business
  logic, unwrapped domain errors, concrete types in `Deps`, adapters making
  RPCs, frontend stores holding server data, unsafe SQL migrations, edited
  generated files. A convention a linter enforces is one an agent can't quietly
  drift from. Deterministic-safe fixes apply automatically; `--json` and
  `--strict` are there for CI.
- **Regeneration is safe.** Every generated file carries a hash of its own
  body. Hand-edit one and the next `forge generate` stops rather than silently
  reverting your work.
- **Boilerplate is scaffolded, so logic is what's left.** `forge scaffold`
  takes a noun — `service`, `entity`, `rpc`, `package`, `adapter`, `worker`,
  `binary`, `operator`, `crd`, `webhook`, `frontend`, `scenario` and more — and
  lands it in the right place, already wired, already conventional.
- **Markers declare intent in one line.** `// forge:entity`, `soft-delete`,
  `append-only`, `secret`, `immutable`, `version` for optimistic concurrency,
  and others make the schema, the RPCs, and the generated code agree about a
  decision you stated once.

### Linting for bug classes, not just style

Most linters argue about formatting. The interesting ones catch **bugs that
compile, pass review, and fail in production** — and that's where Forge's are
aimed.

The distinction matters because architectural drift is how those bugs get in.
A handler that reaches past the service layer straight into the ORM isn't a
style violation; it's a transaction boundary in the wrong place, an
authorization check that now has somewhere to hide, and a query nobody will
find when it gets slow. Shipping today:

- **Layering is enforced.** Handlers may not map errors or carry business
  logic (`no-handler-error-mapping`, `handler-file-size`); `Deps` must be
  interfaces so a layer can't bind itself to a concrete implementation
  (`deps-are-interfaces`); adapters and outbound I/O may not make RPCs
  (`adapter-no-rpc`, `outbound-io-no-rpc`).
- **Migrations are checked before they run.** Adding a `NOT NULL` column to a
  populated table, a volatile default, a destructive change — each caught at
  author time, each with an explicit opt-out for when you mean it.
- **Runtime nil-derefs get caught statically.** `optional-deps-guard` flags an
  unguarded dereference of a dependency that is legitimately nil at runtime.
- **Server state can't leak into client state.** `frontend-stores-no-server-data`
  catches the Zustand store quietly duplicating what React Query owns — the
  root of most "why is the UI stale" bugs.

**Where this is going:** the roadmap is more bug-class analyzers of the same
shape — N+1 query detection, handlers calling the ORM directly instead of going
through the service layer, foreign keys with no supporting index, and similar
patterns that are invisible in review and expensive at scale. These are
**planned, not shipped**; `forge project capabilities` always prints the
analyzers your binary actually has, which is the list to trust over this one.

The reason to build them here rather than bolt on a generic linter is that
Forge already knows the shape of your project — which package is a handler,
which is a service, which struct is an entity, and what the applied schema
looks like. A rule like "this foreign key has no index" or "this handler
skipped its service" needs exactly that structural knowledge, and a
general-purpose Go linter doesn't have it.

---

## 5. Opinions with an exit

Forge's philosophy is **primitives, not modes**: every default is overridable,
every generated file has an owned seam beside it, and no convenience is
implemented as a wall. Stated as pairs, because an opinion is only safe if you
know how to leave it:

- We give you **an ORM** — and you can drop to raw SQL whenever you want.
- We give you **a middleware chain** — in a `serve.go` you own and can reorder.
- We give you **`pkg/`** — as a library you import, not a framework you're
  trapped inside.
- We give you **Kubernetes deploys** — and `External` will just as happily run
  your Fly.io, Cloud Run, ECS, Vercel, Railway, or systemd-on-a-VM command.
- **And you don't have to write Go.** KCL declares the workloads; `ShellBuild`
  builds anything Forge doesn't compile.

That last one is the one people underestimate, so here is the receipt: our own
control plane uses `ShellBuild` to build three services out of a **separate Go
repository**, cross-compiling and pushing images Forge never compiles in-tree —
plus one fat image built by shelling out to GCP Cloud Build, because its
toolchain steps can't be cross-compiled on a laptop.

The details:

- **Deploy is target-agnostic.** Workloads are authored once as a KCL
  `forge.Service`; adapters project them onto Kubernetes and host processes.
  Target selection is structural — a `host` block routes to the host adapter,
  no mode flag.
- **`External` is the generic CLI-driven target** for anything with a deploy
  command: Fly.io, Cloudflare Workers, Cloud Run, ECS, Vercel, Railway,
  systemd-on-a-VM. Forge substitutes `${IMAGE}`, `${TAG}`, `${ENV}` and friends
  and execs it, with optional rollback and health commands.
- **KCL is still KCL.** Forge models _your_ workloads — Application,
  Environment, ConfigMap, Ingress, RBAC. It deliberately does not model
  third-party in-cluster infra, so when you need NATS, Temporal, or a Postgres
  operator, you emit raw manifests (or run Helm) and they compose into the same
  rendered stream. No fork, no fight with the schema. That's how our control
  plane runs all three today.
- **`pkg/` is a library you import, not a framework you're stuck inside.**
  `serverkit`, `svcerr`, `orm`, `auth`, `apikey`, `oauth2`, `observe`,
  `middleware`, `crud`, `tdd`, `testkit`, `pgtest`, `config`, `money`,
  `controller`, `migratekit`, `schemadef`, `seedplan`, `audit`, `validate`, and
  more — `forge project libraries` lists them all with their doc summaries.
  `@reliantlabs/forge-web-runtime` is the TypeScript twin.

---

## The two truths

The one model to internalize before anything else:

- **Proto is the wire truth** — services, RPCs, messages, config.
- **SQL migrations are the schema truth** — `db/migrations/*.up.sql`.

Neither derives from the other. `forge generate` applies your migrations to a
real ephemeral Postgres and introspects the result, so entity structs, the ORM,
CRUD wiring and frontend pages are projected from a schema that provably
exists. Arbitrary Postgres DDL — schema-qualified tables, `JSONB`, arrays,
generated columns — works without Forge needing to understand it.

An entity exists where both halves exist: CRUD RPCs in the proto **and** the
matching table. Either half alone generates honest nothing.

## Who this isn't for

Forge is opinionated at the floor even though it's open at the edges, and some
of those floor decisions won't suit you. Rather than have you discover that in
week three:

- **You don't want generated code in your repo.** Forge writes real files and
  regenerates them. If you'd rather everything be hand-authored, the ownership
  model will feel like overhead instead of a safety net.
- **You need a REST-first public API.** Connect RPC is the native surface.
  Connect handlers speak plain HTTP+JSON and REST URLs are available via
  Vanguard, but if a hand-shaped OpenAPI contract is your product, you'll be
  working against the grain.
- **Postgres isn't your database.** Schema projection introspects a real
  ephemeral Postgres. MySQL, SQLite, and non-relational stores aren't
  supported.
- **You aren't deploying containers.** The deploy model assumes an image, even
  when the target isn't Kubernetes.
- **You want a framework you'll outgrow and replace.** Forge is designed to
  hold structure for the life of the project. If you want a one-time scaffold
  and then never to see the tool again, use a template repo — that's a
  legitimate choice and Forge is the wrong shape for it.

## Install

```bash
# Build the binary into ./bin/forge
task build

# Or install onto $PATH (into $GOBIN)
task install
forge version

# Run straight from source without installing
go run ./cmd/forge version
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Scaffold a new project (service / CLI / library)
forge project new my-app
cd my-app

# Add a service, then regenerate the stack
forge scaffold service billing
forge generate

# The triple gate before you call a change done:
forge generate && forge lint && go build ./... && go test ./...

# Run the inner loop (host services + frontends, no cluster)
forge run

# Or bring the whole stack up (build + deploy + host + frontend)
forge env up dev
```

[**docs/getting-started.md**](docs/getting-started.md) walks this end to end —
service, entity, CRUD, running stack — and explains which files are yours.
[**docs/concepts.md**](docs/concepts.md) covers why Forge is shaped this way.

Run `forge --help` for the full command surface, or `forge <command> --help`
for any one of them. Four commands print Forge's entire surface:

```bash
forge project capabilities   # every verb, every lint analyzer, every marker
forge project annotations    # how proto fields become columns and validators
forge project libraries      # every forge/pkg library and where it lives
forge project audit --json   # what THIS project currently is
```

## Conventions & skills

Forge ships an extensive skill catalog — playbooks covering architecture,
proto, db, api, services, testing, frontend, auth, deploy, observability,
debugging, migration, and code review. The conventions they describe are
enforced by `forge lint`, so prefer loading a skill before guessing:

```bash
forge skill list            # discover what's available
forge skill load <name>     # read one
forge skill search <term>   # find one by keyword
```

Skills are embedded **in the binary**, so `forge skill load` always matches the
Forge you are running. A copy on disk (`.claude/skills/`, a harness preload) is
a render from whenever `forge generate` last ran. When they disagree,
`forge skill load` wins.

`reliant.md` at the repo root captures the critical rules and testing tiers in
brief.
