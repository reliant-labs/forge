// Git-derived version for builds that carry no version of their own.
//
// THE CASE THIS EXISTS FOR is narrow, and worth stating precisely because the
// thing it replaced was applied far too broadly.
//
// Go stamps a real pseudo-version into build info for almost every build:
// `go install ...@v0.1.16` records the tag, `@main` records a pseudo-version,
// and a local `go build` records one too — even from a dirty tree
// (`v0.1.16-0.20260916085636-c01e07ec6ef2+dirty`). So Version() has a
// truthful answer already in all of those.
//
// It has none in exactly one shape: forge compiled INTO a host binary through
// a workspace. reliant `use`s ../forge in a go.work, so forge appears in
// reliant's build info as a dep at "(devel)" with no version, and the vcs.*
// settings describe RELIANT's tree, not forge's. Nothing in build info can
// name forge's version there.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACED, and why it was wrong. That case used to fall back to
// the embedded VERSION file — the last RELEASED version — suffixed "+dev".
// The source is arbitrarily far AHEAD of that release, but semver ignores
// build metadata, so `v0.1.15+dev` compared EQUAL to a released `v0.1.15`.
// kclvendor's downgrade guard allows an equal-version overwrite, so a
// workspace build of main (containing a fix) and a released binary (without
// it) were indistinguishable — which is how forge#202's namespace-scoped
// operator ClusterRole/Binding scoping came within one `forge generate` of being reverted
// in control-plane. A floor that fabricates an ordering is worse than no
// version at all, because the ordering it invents is the wrong one.
//
// So this derives the REAL version from the checkout the binary was compiled
// from, in the same form Go itself would have produced, and returns "" rather
// than guessing when it cannot.
