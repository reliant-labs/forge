// Forge runs two ways on one machine, and they can be DIFFERENT BUILDS:
//
//  1. standalone — `go install ./cmd/forge`. forge is the MAIN module.
//  2. embedded   — another binary (reliant) imports
//     github.com/reliant-labs/forge/cli and mounts NewRootCmd() as a
//     subcommand. forge is then a DEP of that binary, usually behind a
//     local `replace` to a sibling checkout, and only changes when the
//     HOST binary is rebuilt.
//
// Install one and not the other and a single PATH carries two forge builds
// that can disagree about the same project tree — most sharply at the
// forge/pkg compatibility handshake, which one build passes and the other
// fails. Nothing in that failure used to say "a different forge build
// generated this tree."
//
// Build is the identity that makes the two distinguishable. It is derived
// from the binary's own runtime/debug build info, so it works for anything
// `go install`/`go build` produced and needs no build-system change; ldflags
// stamps, when present, take precedence.
