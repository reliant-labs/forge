// Package buildtarget owns the per-service build dispatch for services
// whose source lives outside the project's Go module — sibling repos,
// third-party binaries, language runtimes forge doesn't natively build.
// Mirrors internal/deploytarget for the BUILD side: a service declares
// `build = forge.ShellBuild { cmd, cwd, env }` on its KCL Service (the
// SINGLE shell escape hatch), and forge runs that command via `sh -c`
// instead of the built-in Go-build pipeline. The Spec's BuildCmd/BuildCwd/
// BuildEnv fields below are the RESOLVED form of that ShellBuild.
//
// Design notes:
//
//   - Mirrors External (deploy provider) in shape — same `sh -c`
//     execution. The `cmd` is a plain KCL string that forge runs
//     VERBATIM: there is no token substitution and forge exports no
//     ${IMAGE}/${TAG}/${REGISTRY}-style variables, so every `$VAR` in the
//     command is the shell's. Anything forge knows is composed in KCL,
//     where the value already lives. The build side and deploy side
//     are ORTHOGONAL: a service can have a ShellBuild (build externally)
//     AND `deploy = K8sCluster { ... }` (deploy to in-cluster) — the
//     typical cp-forge pattern.
//
//   - A missing cwd is a HARD FAILURE, not a skip. The dispatcher
//     only constructs a Spec for services that are IN the current env, so
//     by the time a Spec reaches Runner.Build its inputs are expected to
//     exist; a missing source tree (e.g. an un-checked-out sibling repo)
//     means the build that was supposed to run can't — and reporting
//     success would let a following deploy reference an unpushed image.
//
//   - The user's command owns BOTH the build AND the push. Forge does
//     NOT run `docker push` afterwards. Matches External's "user owns
//     the command end-to-end" contract.
//
// The runner is split from the dispatcher so unit tests can inject a
// fake commandRunner without spawning a real shell — the External
// provider's testing pattern.
//
// Phase 1 landed the schema + token helper. Phase 2 (this commit)
// wires Runner.Build into internal/cli/build.go and persists per-
// service state. Phase 3 adds audit + doctor surfaces.
//
//forge:exclude-contract: the `sh -c` shell-build escape hatch the CLI dispatches for out-of-module sources; no Service/Deps/New to bind and no I/O client to fake
