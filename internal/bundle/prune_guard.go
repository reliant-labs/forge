// The PRUNE GUARD: stamping `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/prune: disabled` onto
// the objects a reconciler must never delete.
//
// WHY A RECONCILER NEEDS A GUARD AT ALL. A Kustomization with `prune: true` is
// what makes the bundle authoritative: an object the path no longer carries is
// deleted, so a removed workload actually goes away instead of outliving the
// render that declared it. That is the behaviour we want for a Deployment and
// catastrophic for a PersistentVolumeClaim — and the trigger is not a human
// deciding to delete anything. It is a RENDER THAT MERELY FAILED TO PRODUCE
// the object: a `--target` that selected a subset, a KCL conditional that went
// false, a workload renamed in one place and not another. The bundle comes out
// one document short, the Kustomization notices, and the data is gone.
//
// WHY AT BUNDLE WRITE TIME, AND NOT ON THE POINTER. The annotation lives on
// the OBJECT, inside the bundle, rather than being configured on the
// Kustomization forge writes. Three things follow from that, and the third is
// the reason:
//
//  1. every reconciler that ever applies these bytes honours it — including
//     one forge did not write the pointer for, and a `kubectl apply` of the
//     unpacked layer by hand;
//  2. it is sealed under the bundle's digest, so "was this release protected"
//     is answerable from the artifact rather than from the cluster's current
//     configuration;
//  3. it cannot be forgotten by a writer. A guard configured per-pointer is
//     one every future pointer-writing path has to remember, and the failure
//     mode of forgetting is silent until the day a render drops a PVC.
//
// WHICH OBJECTS. The union of two rules, deliberately:
//
//   - [release.StatefulKind] — the well-known kinds whose removal destroys
//     data or everything under them (PVC, PV, StatefulSet, Secret, Namespace,
//     CRD). Recognised by KIND, so no declaration is needed and a project
//     cannot fail to opt in.
//   - `ShapeObject.Stateful` — an object whose KIND does not say so but which
//     holds data anyway, in practice a declared ManagedDatabase's objects (a
//     `postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 Cluster` is just a CR to Kubernetes). This
//     arrives as the workload names in [ShapeInput.StatefulWorkloads].
//
// It is the same union the PLAN uses to raise a stop-class finding on a
// removal, and [release.StatefulKind] exists so the two cannot drift. An
// object the plan calls irreplaceable and the reconciler prunes anyway would
// be a divergence discovered only by losing the data.
//
// STAMPED BEFORE THE HASH, which is what keeps the shape honest. The shape's
// per-object hash is over the document as PACKAGED, so stamping after the
// projection would make every object's recorded hash describe bytes the layer
// does not carry — and drift detection compares the live object against that
// hash, so every guarded object would read as permanently drifted. The stamp
// therefore happens in the parse pass, on `parsedDoc.body`, before
// [shapeObjects] hashes it and before [packManifests] serializes it.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: it does not stop forge, a human, or `kubectl delete`
// from removing the object. It removes one actor's ability to do it as a side
// effect of a render — which is the actor that would do it without anybody
// deciding to.
