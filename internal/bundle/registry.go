package bundle

// The registry transport: pushing a bundle, and fetching one back.
//
// Both halves are expressed against NARROW interfaces declared here rather
// than against oras's Target, for the usual reason — the larger the
// interface, the weaker the abstraction, and this package needs three
// operations: push a blob, resolve a reference, read a blob. A registry
// client that grew into this package's public surface would make every future
// caller depend on oras's types to do anything, and would make the in-process
// test registry impossible to substitute.
//
// VERIFICATION IS NOT OPTIONAL AND NOT ADVISORY. Everything this package
// reads from a registry is hashed as it is read and the read FAILS if the
// hash diverges. That is the whole basis on which a bundle can be the record
// of what was shipped: without it, a substituted blob would be applied as
// though it were the bytes the ledger named.
