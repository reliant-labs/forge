package bundle

// Republishing a bundle: moving bytes that already exist from one store to
// another, without re-rendering them.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A machine-ledger env's bundle is written into the ledger's
// own OCI LAYOUT — a directory — because a local env's bundle is not shipped.
// That is the right default and it holds right up until the env turns out to
// have an IN-CLUSTER RECONCILER, which cannot read a directory on a
// developer's laptop. So the deploy publishes the recorded bundle to the
// env's registry and points Flux at it.
//
// REPUBLISHING IS NOT REBUILDING, and the distinction is the whole safety
// property. [Build] renders; this copies. If the deploy re-rendered instead,
// the bytes Flux fetched would be a function of the checkout at DEPLOY time —
// a moved sibling repo, a different forge, a dirty tree — and the digest the
// ledger recorded would describe something else. Here the digest is an INPUT:
// the bytes are read by it, verified against it, and written under it, so the
// artifact Flux applies is byte-identical to the one the ledger named or the
// operation fails.
//
// IT IS IDEMPOTENT, because a bundle is content-addressed and a registry
// treats an existing blob as success ([Push] says why). So a deploy may
// republish on every run without cutting a second record of the same bundle,
// and a retry after a lost response costs nothing.

// Republish copies the bundle at `digest` from `src` to `dst` and returns the
// digest it wrote.
//
// EVERY BYTE IS VERIFIED ON THE WAY THROUGH, by the same [readBlob] the
// registry fetch path uses: each blob is hashed as it is read and the read
// fails if the hash diverges. That is not belt-and-braces over a local
// directory — it is what makes the claim "Flux applies the bytes the ledger
// recorded" true rather than assumed, and the local layout is a directory a
// human can edit.
//
// The returned digest is the one actually written, and a caller should pin its
// pointer to THAT rather than to the digest it asked for. They are equal — the
// manifest is read by digest and pushed unmodified — and returning it keeps
// the caller from having to take that on trust.
