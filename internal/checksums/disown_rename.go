// ── Renames must carry a disown with them ─────────────────────────────
//
// `forge project disown` is the sanctioned one-way exit: after it, the path
// is the user's and no `WriteGeneratedFile*` call touches it again. That
// guarantee is keyed on a PATH, and forge occasionally renames an emitter's
// output (mounts_services.go → mounts_services_gen.go, pkg/config/config.go
// → config_gen.go, db/embed.go → embed_gen.go, …).
//
// A rename used to void the disown silently. The record still named the OLD
// path, so the NEW path looked unowned, and forge emitted a second file
// declaring the same symbols right beside the user's — a package that does
// not compile, produced with no error and no warning. That is the worst way
// to break the exit: not by refusing, but by generating code that collides
// with work the user was promised forge would leave alone.
//
// WHY CARRY OVER RATHER THAN REFUSE. Refusing would be defensible — forge
// could stop and tell the user to re-disown under the new name — but it
// makes forge's OWN internal bookkeeping the user's problem. The user
// disowned a FILE, meaning "this output is mine now"; which filename forge
// happens to emit it under is forge's decision, taken between two versions,
// and the user did nothing to invalidate their own intent. Refusing would
// also hard-block `forge generate` on a project that is otherwise correct,
// for a condition the user cannot see coming and forge can resolve exactly.
//
// So: the disowned FILE MOVES to the new path and the record moves with it.
// The user's bytes are preserved verbatim; only the name changes, which is
// precisely the change forge made. Afterwards the new path is disowned, so
// the emitter's write skips it exactly as it would have before the rename —
// no collision is possible, because the emitter's target path is the one
// holding the user's file. It is loud (DisownCarryNoticeFn) because a file
// changing name under the user is a thing they must be told.
//
// The move is SAFE-ONLY: if something already occupies the new path, forge
// does not overwrite it. See CarryDisownAcrossRename.

// DisownCarryNoticeFn is invoked once per disown record carried across an
// emitter rename. Package var so the CLI can capture the report; the
// default prints to stderr. Never nil it out — assign a no-op in tests.
var DisownCarryNoticeFn = func(oldRel, newRel string) {

// blockedThisRun is the set of paths a refused disown carry-over has taken
// off the table for the rest of this run.
//
// It is what makes REFUSAL actually safe. Reporting the conflict is not
// enough on its own: the emitter calls the retirement helper and then writes
// its new path regardless, and that write is exactly the collision this
// whole mechanism exists to prevent — a fresh render landing beside the
// user's disowned copy, both declaring the same symbols. So a refusal also
// BLOCKS the write. The user is left with the two files they already had
// (nothing destroyed, nothing added) plus a runbook naming the fix.

// happens, newRel is a disowned path and the writer skips it.

// The safety rules, in order:
//
//   - No disown on oldRel → nothing to carry; the normal retirement path
//     (reclaim forge's own pristine copy) applies.
//   - oldRel is already gone → the record alone is re-keyed. The user
//     deleted their copy, which is the documented re-adoption gesture; the
//     stale record must not keep pointing at a path that no longer exists.
//   - newRel already disowned → the user has already taken ownership under
//     the new name too. Drop the old record and leave both files alone.
//   - newRel occupied by forge's own PRISTINE render → that copy is forge's
//     to remove (same test the retirement path uses), so remove it and move
//     the user's file in.
//   - newRel occupied by anything else → REFUSE, loudly, via
//     DisownCarryConflictFn. Forge will not overwrite a file it did not
//     write, and the old record is KEPT so the user's copy stays protected.
