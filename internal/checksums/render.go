// Side-render bookkeeping.
//
// Two consumers remain now that the fork lifecycle is gone:
//
//   - `forge generate --explain-drift` parks transient fresh renders
//     under `.forge/render/<relpath>` so the post-pipeline diff can show
//     "on-disk vs what regeneration would produce" without touching the
//     user's drifted file (WriteSideRenderNoBase).
//   - `forge unfork --merge` — the one-release migration aid for LEGACY
//     forks — three-way-merges ours/base/theirs from
//     `.forge/render/<relpath>` and `.forge/render-base/<relpath>`,
//     renders parked by pre-disown forge versions. Current forge never
//     writes render-base; the constants survive only so the migration
//     tool can find what older versions left behind.
//
// Both directories sit under `.forge/`, which the scaffolded project
// .gitignore already excludes (only disowned.json / hashes.json /
// friction.jsonl are negated back in) — side renders are per-developer state, never
// committed.
