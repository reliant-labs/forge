//
// DERIVATION. The set of scaffold-once write sites is derived by PARSING
// the Go source of forge's generation packages (go/ast) and finding calls
// to the known scaffold-once writers. It is not a hand-maintained list: a
// list would go stale the moment someone adds a writer, which is the
// failure mode this guard exists to prevent. The assertion then checks
// that each such site's enclosing function also consults the ledger.
//
// EMPTY SETS FAIL LOUDLY. If the AST walk finds zero call sites, the walk
// itself has broken (a moved package, a renamed helper) and every
// assertion below would be vacuously true. That is reported as a failure,
// not as a pass.

// function that calls one of these makes the birth decision itself.
//
// Calling one is NOT by itself a defect. Two shapes use these writers and
// only one is scaffold-once:
//
//   - RECONCILERS (handlers.go, handlers_crud.go, compose.go,
//     lifecycle.go, providers.go's ORM retrofit) write in BOTH arms —
//     create when absent, splice additively when present. Forge is a
//     steward of part of their content by design, so an absent file is
//     genuinely a file to create.
//   - SCAFFOLD-ONCE writers write in ONE arm only: absent → render, present
//     → return. That single-armed shape IS the defect, because its only
//     question is "is it here?" and a deleted file answers the same as a
//     never-written one.
//
// So the guard below flags a function only when it both calls a raw writer
// and has a presence check whose exists-branch returns without writing.
// Deliberately forge's OWN raw writer only, not os.WriteFile.
//
// An earlier version of this guard also matched os.WriteFile, on the
// reasoning that some scaffold emitters render and write bytes directly.
// That did find three real defects (the frontend nav/dashboard scaffolds,
// the hooks starter test, the middleware contract test — all now fixed),
// but os.WriteFile is forge's most common call and the great majority of
// its Stat-gated uses are not scaffolds at all: temp probes, buf tool
// configs, workspace package.json files, `forge new` bootstrap. Keeping it
// meant an allowance list that grew without bound, and an allowance list
// that grows without bound is a guard being negotiated down one entry at a
// time until it means nothing.
