// Whether a promotion was APPLIED, as the ledger can say it.
//
// A promotion is a pointer, and the apply that realizes it is a second event
// that can fail. On 2026-10-07 prod's binding moved to a release whose apply
// then failed, and every reader — `env status`, `--history`, the next plan —
// presented that release as what prod ran. Nothing in the ledger said
// otherwise, because nothing had been written to say it.
//
// Both ledgers now record the apply's verdict on the promotion it realized:
//
//   - a HOSTED ledger as a recorded gate named "apply" (the same post-promote
//     evidence `forge gate record` writes), so every reader of the control
//     plane's ledger sees it, not just this machine;
//   - a FILE ledger as the machine ledger's apply record (beginApplyRecord),
//     which already existed and is read here.
//
// The readers below turn either into one fact: this promotion's latest apply
// FAILED, with what it said.
//
// The hosted gate is also a LEDGER-ONLY env's applied baseline: its details
// name the bundle the apply shipped, and the next plan diffs against the
// newest passed one (deploy_plan_applied.go). The machine ledger's apply
// record already served a file-ledger env that way.
