//
// The `unscoped_auth` audit category: an RPC whose proto declares
// auth_required: true, whose handler body never resolves the caller.
//
// Why this is a category and not a comment
//
// The CRUD shim template already says the thing. Above every delegating
// method it emits, verbatim:
//
//	AUTHENTICATED, UNSCOPED: this RPC's proto declares auth_required: true,
//	so the interceptor rejected any caller without a valid token before this
//	ran. Nothing below reads WHO they are — call middleware.GetUser(ctx) above
//	the delegation and scope the rows it touches to those claims.
//
// A measured run read that comment, wrote a plan that repeated it back
// ("later work can add authorization/row scoping in owned CRUD
// delegations"), and shipped sixteen delegations that read no caller. One
// signed-in user could read, list, update and delete another user's rows;
// the update path let them reassign a row to themselves outright. Every
// gate the run ran was green, because a comment cannot fail. That is the
// defect this file addresses: not that forge failed to diagnose the hole,
// but that its diagnosis was unfalsifiable.
//
// What it derives from
//
// Both sides of the comparison are computed by the producer, never
// grepped out of rendered prose:
//
//   - The AUTHENTICATED set comes from gen/forge_descriptor.json —
//     protoc-gen-forge's own projection of (forge.v1.method).auth_required,
//     the same field that drives pkg/middleware/procedures_gen.go and the
//     interceptor's fail-closed set. Reading it through
//     codegen.ParseServicesFromProtos means this category and the
//     interceptor can never disagree about which RPCs are authenticated.
//   - The READS-THE-CALLER set comes from the go/ast of the user-owned
//     handler files, resolved through the SAME auth seam the scaffold
//     names (codegen.CRUDAuthSeamFunc / CRUDAuthSeamPkg) plus the claims
//     accessors that seam re-exports. Renaming the seam moves this check
//     with it; nothing here hardcodes the string "GetUser".
//
// A handler counts as reading the caller if its body reaches the seam
// directly, OR passes something derived from it into a callee, OR calls a
// helper in its own package that reaches the seam at ANY depth — the
// reachable set is a fixed point over the package's call graph, so
// `ListCustomers -> scopedList(s, …) -> s.caller(ctx) -> GetUser(ctx)`
// resolves the same as a handler that calls the seam itself.
//
// That depth is not generality for its own sake. This check shipped with
// a single hop, and against a real downstream app it reported all 63 of
// its correctly-scoped CRUD RPCs as unscoped: the app had factored the
// rule into one generic free helper per operation — the DRY way to scope
// a generated surface, and the shape forge's own authorization guidance
// steers people toward — which put the seam two hops away. A one-hop
// reading of that is a false alarm whose suggested remediation is
// ALREADY IMPLEMENTED, leaving the developer nothing to do but disable
// the check. At warn that was an over-warning; with the `forge:owner`
// gate below it breaks the build, and a gate that fails on the
// recommended factoring does not keep its authority long.
//
// False positives cost more than false negatives here
//
// A legitimately global authenticated RPC exists: an admin list, a lookup
// already keyed by something caller-scoped, an RPC whose scoping lives in
// a row-level-security policy. Those are not defects and must not be
// reported forever, so the author can say so IN CODE:
//
//	// forge:auth-unscoped-ok: operator console list; every caller of this
//	// RPC is an admin, so there is no narrower scope to apply.
//	func (s *Service) ListAuditEvents(...)
//
// A directive with no reason after the colon does not count — an
// acknowledgement that says nothing is the comment problem again. It
// lives in the handler file rather than a config file specifically so it
// shows up in the diff that introduces it, next to the code it excuses.
//
// Advisory by default, GATING where row ownership was declared
//
// This category shipped warn-never-error, for a reason that was sound as
// far as it went: a freshly-scaffolded project is ENTIRELY unscoped by
// construction — forge emits the delegations, the user writes the
// scoping — so erroring unconditionally would make forge's own output
// fail forge's own gate, the invariant TestE2EFreshScaffoldLintExitsZero
// pins.
//
// It was also not enough. Measured, against a real downstream app built
// with this file already in place: forge reported
//
//	warn  unscoped_auth: 63 of 74 authenticated RPC(s) never resolve the caller
//
// and exited 0. Any authenticated user could read, UPDATE, DELETE and
// CREATE rows belonging to every other one. The header above this one
// documents the SAME incident at 16 RPCs and states the principle — "every
// gate the run ran was green, because a comment cannot fail" — and then
// the control it introduced was itself non-gating, so the incident
// recurred at four times the scale. A warning nobody must act on is a
// comment with a JSON schema.
//
// What was actually missing was not severity but a PREDICATE. "Unscoped"
// is a fact about handlers; "these rows belong to someone" is a fact
// about data, and this category could observe only the first. A project
// that never says any row belongs to anyone has no boundary to cross, and
// treating it the same as one that does is what forced the choice between
// "always warn" and "break every fresh scaffold".
//
// schemadef.ColumnMarkerOwner — `forge:owner` in a column's COMMENT — is
// the developer supplying the missing half:
//
//	COMMENT ON COLUMN customers.company_id IS 'forge:owner';
//
// No table declares it        → status is warn, exit 0. A fresh scaffold,
//                               an app whose rows belong to nobody in
//                               particular, a CLI: untouched, and the
//                               finding is still reported.
// At least one table does     → an authenticated RPC over an owned entity
//                               that never resolves the caller is an
//                               ERROR. Every OTHER unscoped RPC stays a warning.
//
// The gate is therefore armed by a sentence the developer wrote, never by
// a heuristic forge guessed, and it arms per-entity rather than
// project-wide: declaring an owner column on `customers` does not make an
// unscoped RPC over a global product catalog a failure. Forge still ships
// no ownership of its own and injects no WHERE clause — the marker
// declares that a boundary EXISTS, and the developer writes what it is.
//
// The `forge:auth-unscoped-ok: <reason>` escape hatch suppresses the
// ERROR, not merely the warning — a gate with no way to say "this one is
// deliberate" is a gate people disable wholesale. The reason is still
// mandatory: a bare directive is the unfalsifiable comment again, and
// must not become a one-line bypass.
//
// What this does NOT catch, stated plainly
//
// The RPC→table join is the CRUD-name derivation (ParseCRUDOperation plus
// naming, exactly as BuildSchemaEntities does it), so a custom RPC —
// `TransferOrder`, `ArchiveWorkspace` — maps to no entity and cannot arm
// the gate however many owned tables it touches. That is a real coverage
// hole, not a design intent: the gate covers the generated CRUD surface,
// which is where the measured incidents happened, and a custom RPC over
// owned data is still reported as a warning.

// of declarations in the package — so a recursive or mutually recursive

// recursing down call edges is also why no cycle detection is needed:

// receiver's type, and type-checking a handler package that may not even
// compile is not something a security audit should depend on.
//

// the seam. If `scope` names both a method that resolves the caller and
// a free function that does not, a handler calling `scope(ctx)` is NOT
