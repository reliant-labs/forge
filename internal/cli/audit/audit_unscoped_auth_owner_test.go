// These tests pin the ARMING rule: `unscoped_auth` gates on a
// DECLARATION the developer wrote, never on a heuristic.
//
// The category has always diagnosed the hole correctly and always
// reported warn, on the reasoning that a fresh scaffold is entirely
// unscoped by construction so erroring would make forge's own output
// fail forge's own gate. That reasoning is sound and these tests keep
// it true — the fixture with no owner declaration must stay warn.
//
// What it missed is that "unscoped" and "unsafe" are different
// claims. A project that never says any data belongs to anyone has no
// ownership boundary to breach; a project that declares one has told forge
// the exact thing the fresh-scaffold argument assumed it could not know.
// `forge:owner` in a column's COMMENT is that declaration, and it is
// what moves the finding from advisory to gating.
//
// Both sides stay COMPUTED, matching the rest of this category: the
// owned table set comes from the migrations (the applied
// schema's own source of truth, the same text `forge lint`'s
// column-marker check reads), and the RPC→table mapping comes from
// codegen.ParseCRUDOperation plus naming — the identical derivation
// BuildSchemaEntities uses to join protos to tables. Nothing here greps
// prose.

// writeOwnerMigration lays down a migration declaring col on table as
// the owner of its rows, in the same COMMENT ON COLUMN form a real
// migration would carry.
