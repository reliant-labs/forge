//
// The part of `unscoped_auth` that looks at hand-written SQL.
//
// # Why the caller-resolution predicate is not enough here
//
// The neighbouring file classifies an RPC by one question: does the
// handler body reach the auth seam? That question is a sound proxy for
// "is this scoped" in the case it was designed against — a delegating
// CRUD handler, where the scaffold has already written the query and
// resolving the caller is the only step left undone. Forge knows the op
// seam in that case, which is why it can hand back a wrapper that
// finishes the job.
//
// It is a proxy for nothing at all when the query is a Go string. The
// generated ORM cannot express GROUP BY or SUM, so forge itself routes
// every reporting or rollup screen to hand-written SQL — and on the
// other side of that string literal the AST pass is blind. Resolving the
// caller and then omitting the owner predicate is exactly as easy as
// doing it right, and produces the identical ✓.
//
// This is not hypothetical. A measured run declared `forge:owner` on a
// column, scoped thirty CRUD handlers from the wrapper this audit
// printed, and went green. Two aggregation RPCs then read across the
// boundary anyway:
//
//	if _, err := middleware.GetUser(ctx); err != nil {   // the audit saw this
//	    return nil, err
//	}
//	...
//	WHERE vehicle_id = $1 AND recorded_at >= $3          // and not this
//
// Both appeared in `scoped_rpcs`, neither in `unscoped_rpcs`, and the
// command exited 0 over an RPC that returned any owner's rows to any
// signed-in caller who could name a row id. The run's own summary: the
// assurance layer stops at the edge of a SQL string, and this shape
// lives on the other side of that edge.
//
// # Three states, not two
//
// The fix is not to analyse SQL — forge has no business claiming to
// understand an arbitrary query, and a checker that pretended to would
// be the same false confidence wearing a parser. It is to stop
// collapsing two different facts onto one word. "Reaches the seam" and
// "is scoped" were the same answer; they are now three:
//
//	raw SQL over an owner-declared table, owner column ABSENT
//	    → ERROR. Forge is not guessing: it knows the table, it knows the
//	      column the migration declared, and that column appears nowhere
//	      in the query. This is the shape that leaked.
//
//	raw SQL over an owner-declared table, owner column PRESENT
//	    → WARN, reported as UNVERIFIABLE. The column is in the text,
//	      which is evidence; forge still cannot see that the value bound
//	      to it came from the caller's claims rather than from the
//	      request, so it says it did not check. It does not fail the
//	      build: there is no evidence of a defect, only an absence of
//	      evidence of correctness, and those deserve different words.
//
//	raw SQL over a table nobody declared owned
//	    → silent, as before.
//
// The middle state is the one that keeps this honest. Converting "I did
// not check that" into "I checked and it is fine" is the defect the
// whole category exists to remove; converting it into "this is broken"
// would be the same dishonesty pointing the other way, and would train
// the reader to skip the check.
//
// # Not firing on everything is the design constraint
//
// A rule that flagged every raw query would be suppressed within a week,
// and the real leak would be invisible again — this time behind a
// suppression rather than behind a ✓. So three conditions must all hold
// before anything is said: the project declared ownership somewhere, the
// string is shaped like a query rather than prose that mentions a table,
// and the table it reads is one of the declared ones. A metrics rollup
// over a catalog stays silent, and an unarmed project stays silent
// entirely, which preserves the arming model the rest of the category
// runs on: forge ships no ownership of its own, and a fresh scaffold is
// not red on day one.
//
// The escape hatch is the EXISTING `forge:auth-unscoped-ok: <reason>`
// directive, reused rather than duplicated. A second spelling would mean
// a reader who had learned one would be refused by the other.
//
// # What it deliberately does not do
//
// It does not parse SQL, resolve a query built by string concatenation
// at runtime, or follow a helper into another package — the same
// package-local limit the seam analysis has, for the same reason: this
// pass resolves names, not types. Each of those is a false NEGATIVE,
// which leaves the reader exactly where they were. The direction that
// was unacceptable was the false positive ✓, and that one is closed.
