// The env→release promotion ledger, behind a seam.
//
// WHY A SEAM AT ALL. Promotion state answers "which release does prod run",
// and a file inside the repo that PRODUCED the artifact is circular by
// construction: the commit recording "prod runs v1.5.13" cannot be in
// v1.5.13, because it is written after v1.5.13 was cut. So the ledger must be
// able to live somewhere that is not the artifact's own source tree, which
// means the callers must not know where a ledger is.
//
// THE LOCAL BACKEND IS THE DEFAULT, FOREVER. Not a stepping stone. forge with
// no account, on a plane, must stay fully functional: `forge env deploy <env>
// <version>` and `forge env deploy` are core verbs, and a core verb that
// degrades without a login is a product that lied about being local-first.
// What changed is WHERE that backend writes: a machine-scoped, locked store
// under $FORGE_LEDGER_HOME (internal/ledgerfile) rather than
// .forge/promotions inside the checkout. That move closes three defects at
// once — the circularity above, the branch-dependence that made two worktrees
// see two histories, and the append race the old backend documented rather
// than fixed.
//
// ONE MODEL, TWO STORES. Both read and write forge/pkg/release types, both
// serialize them as the same canonical JSON, and both apply release.Decide,
// so "is this a no-op retry" and "what does the env run now" have one answer
// whichever store holds the ledger. See pkg/release's package doc.

// ─── The new record seams ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Three thin capabilities for the records the bundle/apply/session half of
// the design adds. Each is one or two methods, declared HERE at the consumer
// and implemented by whichever store the env selected — the same shape as
// bindingStore, for the same reason: the command layer must not know whether
// an apply was recorded in a file or over an RPC.
//
// They are separate interfaces rather than fields on a widened bindingStore
// because their consumers are disjoint: `forge env build` records bundles,
// `forge env deploy` records applies, `forge env up` reports sessions. A
// store that cannot do one of these simply does not implement it, and the
// caller type-asserts — the pattern ledgerFreshnessChecker and
// bindingHistoryReader already use.

// bundleBlobs is a bundle's OWN BYTES, plus where they were pushed.
//
// Declared HERE, at the consumer, rather than in pkg/release beside
// BundleRecord — the boundary rule this package follows for bindingStore and
// clusterImageLister. A BundleRecord is a DOMAIN record, readable from either
// store and shown to a user; these are transport bytes, meaningful only to
// the two backends and the one command that produces them. Putting them on
// the domain type would also invite a reader to expect a record read back
// from a ledger to carry them, which it never does.
type bundleBlobs struct {
	// Repository is where the bytes were pushed — the reference the
	// control plane checks against the registry subtree it admits, or an
	// OCI-layout reference for the machine ledger.
	Repository string

	// Config is the bundle document blob the manifest's config descriptor
	// names.
	Manifest, Config []byte
}

// bundleRecorder records a built bundle and reads one back. A bundle IS its
// content, so recording is idempotent on (env, digest) and a retry after a
// failed record is free.
//
// IT CARRIES THE BYTES, NOT A DESCRIPTION OF THEM, and that asymmetry is the
// whole contract on the hosted side. RecordBundle on a control plane checks
// digest = sha256(manifest), checks the manifest's config descriptor names
// sha256(config), then decodes that blob strictly and takes the shape,
// provenance, config digest and release FROM THE VERIFIED DOCUMENT (doc
// §6.3). A seam that passed only the BundleRecord could not express that: a
// client able to STATE a shape can state one that disagrees with the bytes it
// pushed, and every reader downstream would then trust the description over
// the artifact.
//
// So both are passed, and each backend uses the half it can verify. The
// machine backend indexes the record and ignores the blobs, which it already
// holds in an OCI layout it owns — there is no second party for it to lie to.
// The hosted backend sends the blobs and lets the server derive the record.

// THERE IS NO applyRecorder SEAM, because nothing ever called one.
//
// F3 declared it — BeginApply before the bytes moved, FinishApply after — and
// F4 asked to widen it with a compare-and-set. Neither half ever acquired a
// production caller: the apply path (cluster.Apply, through the deploy
// dispatch) reports its outcome by SUCCEEDING OR FAILING, and no verb in this
// package brackets it with a record. So the seam, the two methods satisfying
// it, and the hosted client's write half were an interface with no consumer on
// either side.
//
// It is deleted on that ground alone — dead code, removed — and NOT on the
// stronger claim that forge does not apply. Forge DOES apply today, and this
// deletion does not change when it stops.
//
// Where that is heading, so the next reader is not misled either way: every
// real env is moving to build -> OCI bundle -> version store -> Flux applies
// to the target cluster, control-plane included, and forge's direct apply then
// narrows to dev and ephemeral clusters. That removal is a LATER step, after
// control-plane is on the Flux path; nothing here does it, and the client
// apply is untouched by this branch.
//
// If a verb ever does want to bracket an apply with a durable record, a seam
// for it should be designed against that verb's needs rather than restored
// from this one.
//
// The READ side survives and is used: a convergence record is an observation
// the control plane's own observer writes, which forge reads through
// GetLiveView (hosted_apply.go decodes it). internal/ledgerfile keeps the
// reader for a machine ledger's existing apply lines, which `forge ledger
// show` and `forge ledger export` render as history.

// sessionReporter records that a local stack is running here.
//
// Presence only (owner decision O-8): a session is an observation, never a
// promotion, never a deploy target, and it feeds no policy or billing. The
// single method is a report, and repeated reports for one
