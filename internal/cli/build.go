		Use:   "build [environment]",
		Short: "Build the project binary and frontends",
		Args:  cobra.MaximumNArgs(1),
		Long: `Build the project's services and frontends.

This command is a PURE EXECUTOR of the per-service, per-env build
declaration in KCL. With an environment argument it iterates the
services the rendered env declares and dispatches on each service's
build.type:
- go     → go build the declared cmd (CGO_ENABLED=0, stripped) — no
           hardcoded ./cmd; the target package comes from KCL
- docker → docker build the service's image (dockerfile/platform/...)
- shell  → run the verbatim build command

It also builds Next.js frontends (npm run build) and, with --docker,
the shared project image. Output binaries land in the output dir.

Examples:
  forge build                                # Build everything
  forge build staging                        # Scope docker builds/tag resolution to deploy/kcl/staging/
  forge build -t web                         # Build only the "web" frontend
  forge build -o bin                         # Output binaries to bin/
  forge build --docker                       # Also build Docker images
  forge build --debug                        # Build with debug symbols for Delve
  forge build prod --push                    # Build + push to the registry deploy/kcl/prod/main.k declares

--push takes no value. The registry is DECLARED in the env's KCL — the
env's forge.ClusterTarget.registry, or forge.ControlPlane.registry for a
hosted env — the same value forge env up and forge env deploy read, so what
is pushed is what is deployed. An env that declares none fails with the file
and field to set; --push without an env asks for one.

When the declared registry is a k3d-local localhost:<port>, the image is
also tagged registry.localhost:<port>/<name> (LOCAL alias only — the host
can't DNS-resolve registry.localhost, so it isn't pushed; the containerd
mirror config inside k3d resolves that reference at pull time).`,
