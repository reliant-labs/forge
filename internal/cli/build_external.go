// build_external.go is the SINGLE dispatcher for KCL Services whose
// effective build is a ShellBuild (`build = forge.ShellBuild { cmd, cwd,
// env }`) — the one shell escape hatch. Mirrors the deploytarget/External
// provider on the build side — same `sh -c` shape, same ${X} substitution,
// same fail-when-cwd-missing contract. See internal/buildtarget for the
// runner + spec types.
//
// The dispatcher's responsibilities are deliberately narrow:
//
//   - Iterate KCL services whose effective build is a ShellBuild
//     (EffectiveBuildCmd != "").
//   - Build a Spec from KCL fields + the build-loop's resolved tag /
//     registry / target arch.
//   - Run Spec through buildtarget.Runner.Build.
//   - Persist per-service state when the build succeeded so a
//     subsequent `forge env deploy <env>` can pin the same tag.
//
// Build-side ownership boundary: the user's BuildCmd owns BOTH the
// build AND the push (the user composes
// `docker build … && docker push …` into one string). Forge does NOT
// run docker push afterwards. This matches the External (deploy)
// provider's "user owns the CLI" contract — one mental model across
// both escape hatches.

// build_cmd owns build AND push and the image may have been built on a remote
// builder (so the local docker daemon never holds it) OR the local daemon may
// hold a STALE image carrying the same `:tag` from an earlier, never-pushed
// build. A local-daemon RepoDigest read in that situation captures a digest
// that does NOT match what was pushed, and deploy would then pin
