//
// It exists because the project image uses the COPY-pattern Dockerfile
// (`COPY bin/<svc>` into distroless, no in-image `RUN go build`): the host
// build's output IS what ships. A wrong-GOOS/GOARCH host binary (e.g. a
// native darwin/arm64 build produced when the arch resolution is skipped)
// otherwise sails straight through `docker build` and only crashes at runtime
// on the node with `exec format error` → CrashLoopBackOff. distroless does no
// arch emulation, so the mismatch is fatal. This guard turns that runtime
// crash into a fail-fast build error with an actionable message.
//
// expectedArch is the resolved image GOARCH (resolveBuildArchForImage). It is
// compared against the ELF header's e_machine. The check:
//   - the file must parse as ELF (a Mach-O / Darwin binary fails here — that's

//   - the ELF e_machine must equal the expected arch's machine (when we have a
