//
//  1. Only a workload forge BUILDS contributes. A third-party image
//     (`docker.io/library/nats:2.10`) is pulled, never pushed, so including it
//     would have `forge registry login` demand docker.io credentials.
//  2. Only a workload on a runtime that involves a REGISTRY contributes. A
//     workload bound OnHost or OnCompose runs from the local filesystem or a
//     compose file — nothing pulls an image for it, so its declared reference
//     is not a push destination in that env. This is why `forge registry login
//     dev` on a host-only dev env correctly reports nothing to log in to,
//     even though those workloads carry perfectly good references for the envs
//     that DO deploy them.
//
// A hosted FRONTEND counts too. Its static release is pushed to a registry
// exactly as a backend image is — it just lands under the platform's own layout
// segment, which forge appends rather than asking the author for. An env whose
// only publishable thing is a hosted site still has a push destination, and
// omitting it made `forge env build <env> --push` refuse a project that had one.
