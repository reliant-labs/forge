// An UNREADABLE LEDGER IS AN ERROR, NEVER "no anchor".
//
// resolveFreshnessAnchor answers two different questions with one bool, and
// the defect was that it collapsed them. "This env is unbound and the tree is
// dirty, so there is no commit to measure against" is a legitimate stand-down
// — nothing is wrong, and the guard has nothing to compare. "The ledger could
// not be opened, or its promotion log would not decode" is not: the guard's
// whole subject could not be read, and the one thing that must not follow is
// the guard quietly passing.
//
// Both reported enforce=false, so the second case DEPLOYED. A corrupt
// promotions line, a ledger directory whose permissions changed, a project
// whose forge.yaml name went missing — each one silently disabled the
// stale-image guard on the real-money path, and the deploy printed nothing
// about it. That is strictly worse than the false refusal the release anchor
// exists to fix: a refusal is read and acted on, where this is invisible.
//
// So the signature gains an error, and these tests pin the three states apart:
// an anchor, an honest stand-down, and a failure that must stop the deploy.
