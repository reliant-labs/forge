// newCIVerifyTestRunCmd builds `forge ci verify-test-run`.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A Go suite that declines to run its tests exits 0. On the
// reference project, one package and one environment variable apart:
//
//	internal/threads WITHOUT DATABASE_URL:    9 pass / 124 skip → exit 0
//	internal/threads WITH    DATABASE_URL:  103 pass /   1 skip → exit 0
//
// Same exit code. The suite looked green while running 7% of its tests, and no
// tool in the pipeline had a word to say about it. This command is that word.
//
// It does NOT run tests, and that is not an oversight. `forge test` was
// REMOVED (see test_removed.go) precisely because a second spelling of the
// project's suite reports on a different suite than the one the project runs —
// a green exit code for work that never happened. So this reads the record of
// the run the project ALREADY did: the `go test -json` stream, from a pipe or
// a file. The signal costs one extra flag on a run that was happening anyway.
