// Package cmdutil holds cross-cutting helpers shared by forge's own CLI across
// MORE THAN ONE command group (internal/cli and its dir-nested subpackages).
// It is a leaf package — it imports only neutral internal packages — so any
// command group can depend on it without an import cycle back to internal/cli.
//
// Helpers used by a single command stay with that command; trivial stdlib
// wrappers (a one-line os.Stat check) are duplicated locally rather than
// shared. Only genuinely shared logic lives here.

// cmdRoute records, at execution time, how the forge CLI is mounted in
// the EXECUTING binary's cobra tree: no tokens for a standalone forge
// binary (however its file is named), ["forge"] when mounted as a
// subcommand of another root (e.g. `reliant forge`). The forge root
// command's PersistentPreRun records it via RecordCmdRoute before any
// subcommand RunE fires, so Name() and self-invocation
// (internal/cli.forgeExecCommand) reflect the REAL mount instead of
// guessing from the binary's basename.
//
// The basename guess was a silent-degradation trap: a standalone binary
// named anything but exactly "forge" (a temp build, forge-v2) both
// printed un-runnable next-step hints ("forge-v2 forge generate") and
// self-invoked `<exe> forge protoc-gen-forge`, which hit cobra's
// "unknown command" and broke descriptor generation.
