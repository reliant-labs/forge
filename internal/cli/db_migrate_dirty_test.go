//
// The numbered dirty-migration recovery path shipped attached only to the seed
// commands. But the command an operator actually hits the wall with is
// `forge db migrate up`, and that one passed golang-migrate's raw string
// straight through:
//
//	error: Dirty database version 6. Fix and force version.
//	Error: migrate up failed: exit status 1
//
// That text names no forge command, never mentions `forge db migrate force`,
// and never says that forcing runs no SQL. So the dead end the seed message
// closed was still wide open on the most likely path into it.
//
// Two things are pinned here, and the second matters as much as the first:
//
//  1. A database that is ALREADY dirty when `migrate up`/`down` is invoked
//     gets the same recovery path the seed commands give.
//  2. A CLEAN failure — a genuinely broken migration, run against a database
//     with no dirty flag — does NOT. Routing someone to `force` when their SQL
//     is simply wrong tells them to record a migration as applied that never
//     ran, which is worse than the raw golang-migrate string.
