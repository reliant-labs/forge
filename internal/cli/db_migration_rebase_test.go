// THE DEFECT THESE TESTS PIN. Two separate messages told users to run
// `forge db migration rebase <file>` when no such subcommand existed: the
// migrator's missing-migration refusal (pkg/migratekit) and forge lint's
// version rules. Both fire at the worst possible moment — a deploy refusing
// to apply a migration, or a PR being reviewed — and a user who followed the
// advice got "unknown command for forge db migration".
//
// Prose that names a command is an API. These tests make it one: every
// suggested command is resolved against the real command tree, so advice and
// binary cannot drift apart again.
