// `forge db reset` — drop, recreate, migrate to head, seed. One verb.
//
// # Why this command exists
//
// A dogfood run hit a cycle with no forge-supported escape, from a completely
// ordinary sequence: seed a dev database, then add a foreign key.
//
//	forge db migrate up    -> FK violation; the migration fails part-way,
//	                          and the database is left DIRTY at 7
//	forge db seed reset    -> refuses: dirty. "Clear it: migrate force 7"
//	forge db migrate force 6
//	forge db seed reset    -> refuses: applied 6 is BEHIND latest 00007
//	forge db migrate up    -> FK violation ... which is where we came in
//
// Every documented recovery path refuses, and they refuse for OPPOSITE
// reasons. `seed reset` requires a fully-migrated schema; `migrate up`
// requires rows that only `seed reset` can delete. The rows and the schema
// each block the other's repair.
//
// Note the seed data is not "wrong". org_id was born without a foreign key
// (the stem "org" does not resolve to the entity "Organization"), so
// `forge db seed apply` filled it with documented placeholder synthesis —
// `sample_org_id_14` — while organizations.id holds UUIDs. Nothing is
// inconsistent until the FK is added, which is the ordinary act of tightening
// a schema during the birth window.
//
// The author escaped with raw psql: `TRUNCATE ... CASCADE`, then force, then
// up. That is precisely the manual database surgery `forge db --help` tells
// you not to do, and on a shared or remote dev database it would not have
// been available at all.
//
// reset needs NO dirty-state reasoning because it discards the state. That is
// what makes it the one command that cannot be caught in the loop: it does
// not ask what the schema is, it replaces it.
//
// # Why it is safe
//
// It issues DROP DATABASE, so it carries two gates that `seed reset` does not
// get to skip, plus one they now share:
//
//  1. The env must be confirmed dev (requireDevResetTargetIn — the same
//     fail-closed classifier, no override flag).
//  2. The DSN must reconcile with what the env declares (reconcileClaimedDSN
//     — see db_target.go; this closed a real hole where --env dev --dsn
//     postgres://prod-host/app passed the dev check and acted on prod).
//  3. The resolved host and database are PRINTED and confirmed by typing the
//     database name. --yes skips the prompt for non-interactive use.
//
// Forge models exactly one database (config.DatabaseConfig is singular), so
// reset resets THE database the DSN resolves to. It must be honest about
// which one, never guess silently — this machine runs several postgres
// instances holding real state, which is exactly how a silent guess becomes
// a disaster.

// resetOptions is exactly what the flags bind — no more.

// An earlier draft carried two extra fields so tests could bypass the dev
// classifier and inject a declared DSN. forge's own dead-code guard rejected
// it, correctly: production never wrote either field, so the tests were green
// on a shape production cannot produce. That is a false green on the two
// gates that stand in front of a DROP DATABASE — the worst possible place for
// one. Tests now drive the REAL path, pointing projectDir at a temp project
// (deploy/kcl/<env>/config.k marks it development) and the declared DSN at a
// KCL fixture through FORGE_KCL_RENDER_FIXTURE, the seam RenderKCL already

		Short: "DROP the dev database, recreate it, migrate to head, and seed (dev-only)",
		Long: `DROP the dev database, recreate it empty, apply every migration, and seed.
One verb for "this scratch database is wedged — just rebuild it".

This is the way out of a state nothing else can exit. When a migration fails
part-way the database is marked dirty, and the two repairs block each other:
'forge db seed reset' refuses because the schema is behind, while
'forge db migrate up' refuses because the rows only seed reset can delete
violate the new constraint. Adding a foreign key to a column that seeding
filled with placeholders is enough to produce it.

reset needs none of that reasoning because it DISCARDS the state rather than
repairing it. There is no dirty flag to clear and no row to fix: the database
is gone and rebuilt from db/migrations.

It is destructive and dev-only, so it is gated three ways:

  - the environment must be confirmed development (from deploy/kcl/<env>/config.k);
    there is no override flag
  - the connection string must be the one that environment declares — a DSN
    forge cannot reconcile with <env> is refused, not assumed
  - the resolved host and database name are printed and must be confirmed;
    pass --yes for non-interactive use

Prefer 'forge db seed reset' when only the ROWS are bad: it keeps your schema
and migration state, so there is nothing to re-migrate afterwards.

Examples:
  forge db reset                    # confirm interactively
  forge db reset --yes              # non-interactive (CI, scripts)
  forge db reset --dsn "$DATABASE_URL" --yes`,
