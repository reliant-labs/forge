// deployCmdLong is `forge env deploy`'s help text, hoisted out of the command
// declaration so the constructor reads as a declaration rather than as a
// document with a cobra.Command buried in it.
const deployCmdLong = `Make <environment> run a release. TWO FORMS, and the difference is whether you
name a version.

  forge env deploy prod               # SHIP THIS CHECKOUT: build, push, cut a
                                      # release, plan, confirm, deploy, wait
  forge env deploy prod v1.4.0        # deploy a release that already exists
  forge env deploy prod --from staging  # exactly what staging runs

NO VERSION DOES ALL THE DEPLOYMENT BITS. In order: build the env's artifacts at
the current checkout (images, static artifacts) exactly as ` + "`forge env build`" + `
does, push them, cut a release named ` + "`<YYYYMMDD>.<HHMMSS>-<tree12>`" + ` for this
tree, record the env's declared shape, compute the plan, ask you to confirm it,
then promote, apply and wait.

A RELEASE THAT ALREADY HOLDS THIS CHECKOUT IS DEPLOYED, NOT REBUILT. When a
release — whatever it is named, ` + "`forge env build --release`" + `'s included —
records this checkout's clean tree and this forge version, covers every
artifact the env declares, and every image it pins still resolves in its
registry, nothing is built or cut: forge prints "reusing release <v>" and
deploys it. Otherwise it prints "cutting new release <v> because …" before
building. A dirty checkout, another forge version, a -D option, an artifact the
release lacks, or an image the registry no longer holds each cut a new one.

A SCOPED DEPLOY NEEDS A RELEASE. --frontends-only and --target ship part of the
env, so they are refused with NO version: a no-version deploy cuts a release
over every artifact, and cutting one that ships only some of them would record
a release that does not describe what is running. Name the version
(` + "`forge env deploy prod v1.7.1 --frontends-only`" + `) or deploy everything
(` + "`forge env deploy prod`" + `). --dry-run and --explain are unaffected: they cut
nothing, so a scoped preview is an honest question.

NAMING A VERSION BUILDS NOTHING. It deploys a release that was already cut — a
redeploy, a move to an older one, or a spec-change deploy (the KCL moved and the
release did not: name the version the env already runs). A version nobody cut is
an error whose fix is ` + "`forge env deploy <env>`" + `, the form that builds it.

NOTHING IS WRITTEN UNTIL YOU CONFIRM. A promotion IS the deploy — the converger
picks it up within minutes — so the plan is printed and approved BEFORE the
write, not after it. On a terminal you are prompted (default no). In CI pass
--yes, which means "I read the plan". With no terminal and no --yes the command
refuses (exit 5) having built, pushed and cut but written NO promotion, so
approving it afterwards needs no rebuild. --plan-only stops after the plan and
is the first stage of a two-stage pipeline.

--yes AND --approve ARE NOT THE SAME APPROVAL. --yes means "I read the plan"
and approves whatever forge computes at the moment that command runs.
--approve <digest> approves the plan you actually READ: if Live moved in
between — another deploy landed, a new bundle was applied, drift appeared —
the digest no longer matches and the deploy is refused (exit 3) instead of
shipping a change set nobody saw. Use --yes for a one-shot deploy; use
--approve whenever the plan and the approval are separate steps.

THE TWO-STAGE PIPELINE, in full:

  PLAN=$(forge env deploy prod --plan-only --json)    # builds, cuts, writes NO promotion
  VERSION=$(jq -r .target.release    <<<"$PLAN")      # the release stage one cut
  DIGEST=$( jq -r .deploy_plan.digest <<<"$PLAN")     # the plan to bind the approval to
  forge env deploy prod "$VERSION" --approve "$DIGEST"

` + "`next_step`" + ` in stage one's document is that final command already assembled,
including ` + "`--acknowledge-destructive <codes>`" + ` when the plan carries stop-class
findings — those codes cannot be written in advance, because a code is not
known until the plan is computed. Paste it rather than rebuilding it.

A nil ` + "`deploy_plan`" + ` means no plan could be computed (a never-built env, or a
control plane that predates bundles) — NOT "no changes". There is then no
digest to approve, so ` + "`next_step`" + ` falls back to the --yes form and says why.

THE VERB IS record + apply + wait, AND THAT IS NOT OPTIONAL. Recording a
binding ships nothing, so a step that only recorded one reported success before
any byte had moved and the release's actual failure surfaced minutes later with
nothing connecting the two. So the health gate is ON by default; --no-wait is
how you opt out, and it says what to run instead.

A HOSTED DEPLOY CAN BE QUEUED, NOT REFUSED. When what the env runs needs
something only a person can provide — billing for its hosted workloads,
managed database or static sites — the control plane still
ACCEPTS the deploy: the release and its bundle are recorded, the promotion is
written, and the env shows "waiting on billing". It goes live by itself the
moment billing is set up; nothing is re-run. forge prints one block — what it
waits on, why, and the URL to act at — and exits 7. --wait instead blocks
(up to --timeout) until it is live. A newer deploy to the env replaces a
queued one.

WHO APPLIES IT IS DECLARED, NOT CHOSEN. An env whose KCL declares
forge.ControlPlane is converged by that control plane — forge records the
promotion and waits on the rollout the server computes. Every other env is
SELF-MANAGED: the same command renders the new binding and applies it from this
machine, and that apply's per-resource rollout wait IS the health gate. Both
reach "the release is live or this command is red"; which machinery got there
is an implementation detail of where the env runs.

` + "`forge env build <env> --release <version>`" + ` builds the env-agnostic images
ONCE, captures their content-addressed digests, and cuts a release. Naming that
version here advances it BY REFERENCE: one entry — env, release, and the
per-image digests frozen at this moment — appended to the env's append-only
promotion ledger. No image is rebuilt, so the exact bytes cut as <version> are
what every env running that release ships, byte-identical. This eliminates the
per-env rebuild that re-cross-compiles (and can drift arch/tag) for every
environment.

WHERE THE LEDGER LIVES is declared by the environment, not chosen by a flag:
an env whose KCL declares forge.ControlPlane records promotions on that control
plane; every other env records them in .forge/promotions/<env>.jsonl.

EVERY DEPLOY IS A NEW ENTRY, NOT AN EDIT. Re-deploying the release an env
already runs appends nothing and still applies and waits; a CI retry is safe.

THERE IS NO ROLLBACK. Recovery is ROLL FORWARD: cut a release with the fix and
deploy it. Binding an env to an OLDER release is still possible — it is an
ordinary deploy — but it cannot undo the newer release: that release's
migrations stay applied and the data it wrote stays written, so the older code
runs against a schema it was never tested on. The plan labels such a move
` + "`direction: BEHIND`" + ` and says so; read it before you write it.

SEE THE CHANGE BEFORE IT IS WRITTEN. --plan computes the ENTIRE change set and
writes nothing: the release the env runs now versus the one it would move to,
every image classified as unchanged / changed / added / removed (with both
digests where they differ), the git commits between the two releases, and —
the fact most worth reading twice — the DIRECTION. A deploy to an older
release is reported as BEHIND rather than left for you to infer from version
numbers. The plan and the real deploy are computed by the SAME function, so the
preview cannot disagree with the write.

EVERY RELEASE DEPLOY IS A COMPARE-AND-SET. The write asserts that the env is
still on the promotion the plan read (` + "`current.promotion_id`" + ` in --json),
and is REFUSED if someone else moved it since — so a hotfix that lands while a
pipeline waits for approval turns the pipeline red instead of being
overwritten. No flag is needed. --expect-current <id> replaces the planned
value with one captured earlier (e.g. when the approval was requested);
` + "`--expect-current unbound`" + ` (or --expect-unbound) asserts the env has never
been promoted. Re-deploying the release the env already runs is a no-op
whatever the expectation says, so a retried success is never a conflict.

Exit codes (release deploys):
  0  deployed and healthy, or already on this release (no-op), or --plan /
     --plan-only, or a confirmation answered "no" (nothing was written)
  1  failed: invalid input, unreadable ledger, release not found, DEGRADED
  2  undetermined — we could not look (the control plane was unreachable)
  3  promotion_conflict / source_moved — the env (or --from's source) moved
     since the plan was read. Stop and look; retrying would overwrite it
  4  rollout_in_flight / environment_pinned — declined, nothing lost. Wait
     and retry, or pass --supersede (recorded) to replace an unfinished rollout
  5  plan_unconfirmed — the plan was printed and nobody approved it: no
     terminal to prompt on and no --yes. NOTHING was promoted. Add --yes
  6  superseded — the env was promoted past the promotion being waited on
  7  queued — the deploy was ACCEPTED and RECORDED and the control plane is
     holding it on a person (today: billing for the hosted workloads or
     database it runs). Nothing failed and nothing is to be re-run: it goes
     live on its own once they act. The output names what it waits on and
     the action URL (--json: .queued). --wait blocks until it is live instead
  8  the wait's budget expired while the rollout was still progressing

5 USED TO MEAN THE TIMEOUT, which is now 8. The confirmation gate took 5
because it is the one outcome that must be impossible to misread as success:
a pipeline that upgrades without adding --yes exits 5, and even a handler
that still reads 5 as "the wait timed out" fails the job rather than passing
it. Pre-1.0, so this is a clean renumber with no alias.

--json carries the same outcome: ` + "`applied`" + `, ` + "`confirmed`" + ` (whether the gate let
the write happen), and a ` + "`refusal`" + ` object naming what was expected and what is
actually there.

Examples:
  forge env build prod --release v1.4.0            # build once, cut the release
  forge env deploy staging v1.4.0 --plan           # what WOULD change (writes nothing)
  forge env deploy staging v1.4.0 --plan --json    # the same, machine-readable
  forge env deploy staging v1.4.0                  # record, apply, wait
  forge env deploy prod --from staging             # the bytes that passed staging
  forge env deploy prod v1.3.0 --plan | grep BEHIND  # catch a backwards move
  forge env deploy prod v1.4.0 --gate e2e.json     # freeze evidence onto the entry
  ID=$(forge env deploy prod v1.4.0 --plan --json | jq -r '.current.promotion_id // "unbound"')
  forge env deploy prod v1.4.0 --expect-current "$ID"  # after approval: exit 3 if prod moved

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE APPLY (both paths, and the whole of a no-version deploy)

Deploy each service to the target declared on its Service.deploy block.

Supported deploy targets (declared in deploy/kcl/<env>/main.k):

  * forge.K8sCluster — Kubernetes deployment via render → kubectl apply
    → wait-rollouts. Forge auto-creates a k3d cluster for dev.
  * forge.Compose    — docker compose pull + up -d.

forge.HostDeploy and forge.BuildOnly are skipped by deploy — those are
owned by forge run / forge env up and forge build respectively.

Safety (declarative context): the kubectl context is read SOLELY from the
env's KCL — forge.K8sCluster.cluster IS the kubectl context name (e.g.
"gke_<project>_<region>_prod"; defaults to k3d-<project> for dev). Every
kubectl call in the apply/wait/prune/secrets path runs
--context <declared> per command, so the deploy applies to EXACTLY the
cluster the env declares — independent of whatever context is currently
active. There is NO CLI override and NO fall-back to the current context:
the binding lives in the env file, full stop, so you can't deploy the
wrong env to the wrong cluster. forge fails fast (even under --dry-run) if
the declared cluster has no matching kubectl context — the only remedy is
to fix your kubeconfig or the KCL forge.K8sCluster.cluster.

Use --explain to print the declared context, whether it exists in your
kubeconfig, and the verdict without applying.

Machine-readable output: --json emits ONE JSON document covering the whole
invocation, with the same exit code text mode produces. It reports the MODE
actually performed (explain / dry_run / apply) so a consumer never
has to infer whether bytes moved; the guard verdict, the target cluster +
namespace (every declared context, for a multi-cluster env); whether the
preflight ran and its findings as structured entries; per-image digest-vs-tag
pinning, so a deploy shipping a MUTABLE reference is visible rather than
implied; the resource identities applied (kind/name — a diffable list, not a
YAML dump); and the per-resource rollout outcome as three distinct states:
ready, failed, and timed_out / not_waited. A timeout is neither a success nor a
failure — it is the absence of an answer — and the document keeps all three
apart. The human output moves to stderr so stdout carries exactly one document.
Works with --explain and --dry-run, which is how a UI previews a deploy before
asking anyone to confirm it.

Deployability preflight: before the first apply (remote/cloud clusters),
forge verifies against the LIVE target that every Secret KEY the rendered
manifests reference is provisioned and every container image: resolves in
its registry. A missing key (CreateContainerConfigError) or image
(ImagePullBackOff) is reported up front — all at once — and the deploy
refuses to apply, instead of surfacing one pod crash at a time mid-rollout.
The preflight is skipped for local dev clusters and runs under --dry-run as
a pure read-only check. Bypass with --skip-preflight.

Use --target <app> (repeatable) to deploy ONLY the named application(s)
instead of the whole env bundle. It filters by app NAME — service,
operator, or frontend: the K8sCluster apply keeps the targeted app's
workload manifests plus all shared resources (Namespace, the shared
ConfigMap/Secret, RBAC), and the External/Compose dispatch + rollout-wait
are scoped to the named apps. A typo'd target errors with the list of
available app names. Targeting an operator (e.g. workspace-controller)
applies just that operator's Deployment + cluster RBAC.

k8s-only deploy: naming only backend apps via --target is itself the
"k8s without touching the frontend" path — a Firebase frontend isn't in
the --target set, so its build+deploy step never runs. To ship the WHOLE
backend bundle while skipping the frontend (without enumerating every
service), pass --skip-frontend: the k8s apply runs as normal and the
Frontend (e.g. Firebase) build+deploy dispatch is skipped.

Examples:
  forge env deploy dev                          # Deploy to dev (local k3d)
  forge env deploy staging --tag v1.2           # Deploy to staging with specific tag
  forge env deploy prod --dry-run               # Preview prod manifests (guard runs)
  forge env deploy prod --explain               # Show the declared-cluster guard verdict
  forge env deploy dev --namespace custom-ns    # Override namespace
  forge env deploy dev --target admin-server    # Deploy only the admin-server app
  forge env deploy prod --target workspace-controller # Deploy only that operator
  forge env deploy prod --skip-frontend         # Deploy backend k8s, skip Firebase`

// ── Why this warns at all ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// forge is fail-closed nearly everywhere; this is the one place an entire
// workload goes missing without comment. Scaffold a project with a frontend
// and `forge.Frontend` is emitted in exactly ONE env — dev. Staging and prod
// get the frontend's config projection (config.k) but declare no frontend
// workload, so `forge env deploy prod` ships the Go services, says nothing
// about the frontend, and exits 0. The user's app is simply not deployed.
//
// The shape that still produces that silence is a frontend ABSENT from the
// env's rendered bundle: there is nothing to iterate over, so the dispatch
// loop never sees it. A frontend that IS in the env states its runtime (the
// Bundle refuses one that does not), so "on forge.OnHost, ships nothing" is
// a declaration rather than an accident, and is not warned about.
//
// ── Why it warns rather than errors ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Deploying a frontend out-of-band is legitimate — Vercel, a separate
// pipeline, a static host outside forge. Those users are correctly
// configured and erroring would break them, which is worse than the silence
// this fixes. A frontend named by --target is likewise not a surprise.
//
// The runtimes named in the hint are REFLECTED from the embedded schema
// (kcl.DeployTargetsFor("Frontend")), so this text cannot name a runtime the
// schema doesn't accept, and it picks up a newly added one for free. That is
// also why it asks the Frontend union specifically rather than the whole

//     pushed, deploy reads it back, the working-tree state between the

//     --always --dirty`). The standalone-deploy path: no preceding
//     build, no override — recompute the tag the way build would.

// Digest (captured by `forge env build --push`), the returned reference is the
// IMMUTABLE digest form `@sha256:...` instead of the mutable :tag — unless
// noDigest is set. The KCL `_image_ref` seam recognises an `@`-prefixed
// image_tag and pins `<image>@sha256:...`, dropping the env tag. A digest
// can't go stale and can't be re-pointed, so the node-cache / re-tag-didn't-
// take failure class is structurally impossible. Fallback is automatic: no
// captured digest (third-party images, non-pushed builds, the local-registry
// e2e path) → the tag is used exactly as before.
//
// Errors:
//
//   - flagOverride bypasses every error path (the user told us
//     exactly what to use).
//   - A present-but-unreadable state file is a hard error — silently
//     falling back would mask a real bug.
//   - A missing state file is fine; the function falls through to git.
//   - A git-derivation failure on the fallback path is wrapped with a
//     "pass --tag to override" hint so users have an escape hatch.
//
// Return values: (imageRef, plainTag, source, err). imageRef is what the
// KCL manifest render pins — the digest form `@sha256:...` when a digest is

//   - An UNPINNED image (`image = "reliant"`) takes the env tag, so the bare

//     that were never pushed under this tag. Before the tag-qualified key
//     existed there was no way to say that, so a tag-pinned image was left on
//     its mutable tag — the spec never changed between rebuilds, the
//     Deployment never rolled out, and the nodes kept the old digest while

// deploy that was exactly right. The release record is the honest anchor: the
// question "is this image stale?" means "was it built from something other
// than what this release claims", not "was it built from the newest commit in
// my working tree".
//
// When the env is bound to a release, that release is the ONLY valid anchor —
// if it can't be read (missing/corrupt ledger, no recorded commit), this
// reports enforce=false rather than silently falling back to HEAD, because
// falling back is precisely the false refusal above.
//
// Unbound envs keep the original HEAD comparison, which fires only when:
//
//   - HEAD is resolvable, and

//     single HEAD the build can be measured against, so the comparison would
//     be meaningless (warnIfNonReproducible covers the dirty-build
//     reproducibility angle separately). Untracked files (editor dirs, build
//     artifacts, gitignored caches) are deliberately ignored — they don't
//     change which commit HEAD points at, and a stray `.idea/` directory must
//     not silently disable a real-money stale-deploy guard.
//
// A release-anchored comparison needs no git at all: it is ledger-vs-ledger,
// so it stays correct in a dirty tree, in CI, and on a detached checkout.
//
// A RELEASE THE DEPLOY NAMES OUTRANKS THE BINDING. `forge env deploy <env>
// <version>` preflights the release before it records the promotion
// (preflightBeforeRecord), so while this runs the binding still names the
// release the env runs NOW — the one being replaced. Anchoring on it measured
// every new release's build against the old release's commit and refused
// every forward deploy. The named release is the one that ships, so its
// commit is the anchor, the same layering resolveDeployDigests gives its
// pins. Such a deploy never consults the binding here, and when the named
// release cannot anchor it stands down rather than falling back to the
// binding (the release being replaced) or to HEAD (the false refusal above).
// A deploy that names no release re-applies the bound one and is measured
// against it, as before.
//
// AN UNREADABLE LEDGER IS AN ERROR, NEVER "no anchor". There are two reasons
// this function can decline to enforce, and they are not the same fact:
//
//   - "There is nothing to compare against" — the env is unbound and the tree
//     is dirty, or a release records no commit. Nothing is wrong; the guard
//     has no subject, so it stands down. That is enforce=false, nil error.
//   - "The subject could not be read" — the ledger would not open, its
//     promotion log does not decode, the project has no name to key it by.
//     The guard's own input is missing, and the only thing that must not
//     follow is a deploy proceeding as though it had been checked.
//
// Collapsing them is what the defect did: a corrupt promotions line, a ledger
// whose permissions changed, a missing forge.yaml name — each one silently

// WHAT THIS FIXES. The guard compares st.Commit against the env's anchor with
// no regard for whether the record is even ABOUT this env. The `default`
// record a plain `forge build` writes is the common case: it is the shared
// fallback for every env (buildStateLookupEnvs), so one local dev build
// poisons every future release deploy until someone deletes the file.
//
// Measured: the v1.5.18 control-plane release was refused three times by an
// Aug-25 `.forge/state/build-default.json` recording a `forge build` against
// a localhost:5051 dev registry. All four images deployed from release-ledger
// digests in a prod GAR that record had no part in, and its digest appeared
// nowhere in the release. The only ways forward were hand-deleting local
// state or passing --tag, which disarms the guard wholesale.
//
// The registry is the discriminator, and it is the honest one: a record whose
// registry is not the registry this deploy pushes/pulls from cannot be the
// build that ships here, whatever its commit says. That covers the dev-
// registry case above without weakening the guard for a real stale build,
// which by construction carries the env's own registry.
//
// NOT sufficient: "the bound release pins this image". The K8s path renders a
// digest for a pinned image and ignores the tag, but plainTag still reaches
// every provider via buildDeployGroupsForEnv, so a stale tag can genuinely
// ship there. TestResolveDeployImageTag_ReleaseCommitStill
// RefusesOlderImage pins exactly that, and it is right to.
//
// Two conditions, and BOTH are required:
//
//   - The record is the env-AGNOSTIC `default`. A build-<env>.json names this
//     env, so its commit is evidence about this env and is measured as before.
//     `default` is the shared fallback every env reads, so it is the only one
//     whose commit can be about somewhere else entirely.
//   - The record is of a DIRTY tree. A release is cut from a clean checkout
//     (the release scripts refuse otherwise), so a dirty build is by
//     construction not the artifact a release-bound env deploys — it is
//     someone's local iteration. A CLEAN `default` build could genuinely be
//     the thing that ships, so it keeps refusing.
//
// "Release-bound" includes a deploy that NAMES a release: it ships that
// release, and its preflight runs before the binding is written — an env's
// first release deploy has no binding yet (see resolveFreshnessAnchor).
//
// Best-effort by construction: it returns false unless it can positively
// justify standing down, so it never widens a refusal — only withdraws one

// WHY PER CONSUMER. A multi-cluster env runs workloads that read the same
// Secret in more than one cluster. Applying the projection once, to the env's
// primary context, left every other cluster's consumer stuck on
// CreateContainerConfigError — and the only way around it was to call the
// Secret out-of-band (a forge.ExternalSecret the live preflight then blocks
// on) and create it with a script, whose values then drifted from the ones
// forge projected into the primary cluster.
//
// Same trust boundary as the RenderedSecrets provider's inference
// (placeDeclaredSecrets): a value lands only in a cluster that runs one of
// its consumers, and only the keys that consumer declares.
//
// A cluster workload no group claims keeps the historical destination, the
// env's resolved context and namespace, so a single-cluster env renders and
// applies exactly what it did before. The result is grouped and sorted so the
// apply order — and the dry-run output — is stable.
