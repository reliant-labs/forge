// `forge env deploy <env>` with NO version: the one command that ships the
// checkout (owner decision O-15).
//
// THE OWNER'S WORDS: "the whole point is that deploy should do all the
// deployment bits, including building and pushing the release (OCI configs,
// the actual docker images, etc)." What prompted it was hitting this on
// hounders prod, from the UI:
//
//	hosted env "prod" has no promoted release, so there is no digest to
//	deploy … fix: forge env build prod --release <version> --no-build
//	&& forge env deploy prod <version>
//
// Three commands, one of which (--no-build) cuts a release over digests that
// do not exist, to do the thing the operator already asked for.
//
// So, in order:
//
//  1. CHOOSE: reuse a release whose recorded provenance matches this checkout
//     and which still covers the env (deploy_autoversion.go) — then nothing
//     is built or cut, so a retried deploy never builds or cuts twice.
//     Otherwise:
//  2. BUILD at the current checkout, by exactly `forge env build`'s path —
//     images, static artifacts, and F-DECL's shape recording — PUSH, and CUT
//     a release under the auto-version rule.
//  3. PLAN with the existing promote-plan machinery, and print it.
//  4. CONFIRM (deploy_confirm.go) — nothing is written until somebody says yes.
//  5. PROMOTE, apply and wait, by the same path `forge env deploy <env> <v>`
//     takes.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACED, AND WHY THAT IS RIGHT. A no-version deploy used to be a
// "spec-change deploy": re-apply the env's CURRENT binding, for when the KCL
// moved and the release did not. That behaviour is NOT lost — it is what
// `forge env deploy <env> <current-version>` does, which is how §8.5's "Apply
// config" button spells it. What is gone is the spelling, because it made the
// most obvious invocation of the verb the one that could not ship the code in
// front of you. Pre-1.0: the old path is deleted, not kept beside the new one.
