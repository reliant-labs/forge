// The automatic release version a no-version `forge env deploy` cuts, and the
// rule that stops it cutting — or building — twice for one checkout (owner
// decision O-15, doc §7.2 "Auto version").
//
// `<YYYYMMDD>.<HHMMSS>-<tree12>`: the UTC cut time and the first 12 hex of the
// checkout's provenance tree.
//
// WHY THIS SHAPE.
//
//   - It is unique per project (T15) without a read-modify-write of the
//     ledger, so two deploys cannot race for a name.
//   - It SORTS by time, which is what makes `forge env status` and the
//     promote direction logic read correctly against hand-named releases.
//   - The tree makes the name READABLE as content. It is not what reuse
//     matches on: reuse compares the provenance every release RECORDS
//     (chooseDeployRelease), so a release named anything — `v1.4.0`, or a
//     release script's `<date>-<commit>` — is found by what it holds.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN THE NAME. A dirty or branch build carries that
// fact in its PROVENANCE, never in its version (owner decision O-7: no naming
// rule). A name that encoded it would be a policy expressed as a string, and
// every consumer would have to parse it to recover what the provenance
// already states exactly.

// THE MATCH IS ON CONTENT PROVENANCE, NEVER ON THE NAME. A release is reused

//
//   - the SOURCE: the same clean tree hash. Only a clean tree counts, on both
//     sides — a clean tree's hash is the commit's tree, which git can check;
//     a dirty tree's is the building machine's claim about files nobody
//     committed;
//   - the BUILDER: the same forge version. The images and the render are
//     functions of the forge that produced them, so the same tree built by
//     another forge is not the same release;
//   - the ENV's RENDER: the render is a function of the tree, the forge and
//     the `-D` options. The first two are compared above; a release records
//     no options, so a deploy that passes any never reuses. And the release
//     must cover every artifact the env's render declares NOW — each image,
//     each hosted static site, each source-pinned frontend at the commit its
//     pin resolves to today.
//
// And the release must still be deployable: every image it pins is asked of
// its registry, by digest, because a retention window may have expired it
// since the cut. A release the registry no longer serves is not reused.
//
// WHY REUSE BUILDS NOTHING. A build is not reproducible byte for byte: on
// 2026-10-09 a rebuild of an unchanged prod checkout pushed a reliant image
// with a different digest from the one its release, cut minutes earlier,
// pinned. Rebuilding to "make sure the images are there" therefore changes
// the images; asking the registry whether the recorded ones are there does
// not.
//
// Any doubt cuts. A ledger that cannot be read, an env that cannot be
// rendered, a registry that will not answer — each is a reason to build, never
// a reason to deploy bytes nobody verified, and each is named in Reason.
