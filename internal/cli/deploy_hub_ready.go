// Kustomization per connected cluster. Recording a promotion for it is only
// worth doing if that reconciler can apply anything at all.
//
// WHY THIS CHECK EXISTS. forge decides "the hub converges this env" from the
// declaration alone (envConvergedByHub). On 2026-10-07 prod declared its
// connected clusters, the hub created the OCIRepository, and both control-plane
// Kustomizations were Ready=False: Forbidden — the impersonated per-org service
// account had no rights in the cluster. A deploy would have recorded a
// promotion and then waited out its whole budget to an UNKNOWN, with nothing
// connecting the timeout to the hub's own error. The hub had already said what
// was wrong; forge just never asked.
