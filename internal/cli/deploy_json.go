// The deploy REPORT — the whole invocation as one machine-readable document.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. A forge UI now has read-only screens (topology,
// secrets, env status, audit) and a guarded promote, and the rule those were
// built on is that THE UI NEVER COMPUTES ANYTHING THE CLI CANNOT REPORT.
// Deploy was the last command with no machine-readable output at all: 51
// fmt.Printf calls and nothing else, so the only way to learn what a deploy
// did was to read its prose. A consumer that scrapes prose is a consumer that
// silently starts lying the first time a message is reworded.
//
// ONE DEPLOY BODY, TWO RENDERERS, AND THAT IS THE LOAD-BEARING CONSTRAINT.
// This report is INSTRUMENTATION threaded through the existing deploy path,
// not a second computation of the same facts. Every method here is nil-safe,
// so text mode passes a nil *deployReport and runs byte-identically, while
// --json runs the SAME code and reads the accumulator afterwards. A preview
// that disagrees with the deploy would be worse than no preview: it converts
// "I did not look" into "I looked and was told the wrong thing". The exit code
// is the deploy's own returned error either way, so the two modes cannot
// diverge about success.
//
// WHAT A CONSUMER NEEDS, AND WHY EACH PIECE IS MODELLED EXPLICITLY.
//
//   - MODE, unambiguously. "Did bytes move?" must never be inferred. explain
//     and dry_run touch nothing; apply and rollback do. A consumer that has to
//     deduce this from the absence of a field will get it wrong on the day it
//     matters.
//   - The GUARD, as data. The deploy applies to the context the env's KCL
//     DECLARES, never the ambient current-context, and the only failure is a
//     declared context absent from the kubeconfig. That verdict is the single
//     most consequential thing to show a user before they confirm.
//   - The TARGET. Which cluster and namespace, so a UI can put the words
//     "production" in front of someone before they press the button.
//   - PINNING, per image. Live verify already caught prod's internal-console
//     running by mutable tag, so "this deploy ships a tag, not a digest" is a
//     real safety fact and gets a field rather than a footnote.
//   - ROLLOUT, three ways. ready / failed / (timed_out | not_waited). A
//     timeout is NOT a success and NOT a failure — it is the absence of an
//     answer, and a document that collapses it into either one is the "green
//     deploy over a broken environment" failure this project already paid for
//     once.
//
// ZERO VALUES ARE THE SAFE READING, EVERYWHERE. Every enum below has
// "unknown" as its zero value and an UnmarshalJSON that REFUSES a string it
// does not recognise. The tempting zero values — allow, ready, digest,
// applied — are each the one answer that makes a real problem invisible, and a
// lenient decoder in an older binary reading a newer forge's output would
// produce exactly that. promote_plan.go's decoder is the model; this follows
// it deliberately rather than by coincidence.
