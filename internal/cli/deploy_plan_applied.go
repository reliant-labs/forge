// THE PLAN OF AN ENV FORGE ITSELF APPLIES, against what forge last applied.
//
// A LEDGER-ONLY env (envLedger.ledgerOnly: a hosted ledger, nothing bound to
// its control plane — control-plane prod) is converged by nothing but this
// machine's apply. Its control plane records promotions and observes nothing:
// it holds no deployment rows to carry an applied_bundle_id, and no Flux it
// could read a convergence from. So the server's PlanDeploy had no Live to
// diff against, ever — every prod plan on 2026-10-10 carried 177 `object_added`
// for objects that had existed for months, 28 `secret_needed` warns for Secrets
// that had not moved, and no way to show a removal at all. A real change was
// indistinguishable from the noise, and four releases were approved on it.
//
// THE ACTUATOR PLANS. The plan is computed by whoever applies the env, because
// only the applier can see what the plan has to read:
//
//   - LIVE is the bundle of this env's newest SUCCEEDED client-side apply. The
//     apply records it as evidence on the promotion it realized — the "apply"
//     gate (apply_outcome.go), whose details name the bundle digest — so the
//     baseline is on the env's own ledger, keyed by env and digest, readable
//     from any machine that can deploy, and attributed by the server to the
//     credential that applied.
//   - SECRET PRESENCE for an `external` secret is the target cluster's own
//     Secret, read keys-only (deploy_plan_secrets.go): the control plane
//     cannot see a self-managed cluster, and forge holds its kubectl context.
//     A `hosted` secret is still read from the control plane's store, as the
//     server's plan read it.
//
// It is the same release.BuildPlan the server and the file ledger run, over the
// same rules, so a finding means the same thing on every backend. What differs
// is only who could observe the inputs — which was the defect.
//
// THE DIGEST IS NOT SENT ON THE WRITE for such an env (serverPlanDigest). The
// control plane re-verifies a digest it is given by recomputing the plan, and
// it cannot recompute one over Live it never sees; it would refuse every
// approval as plan_stale. The approval is still binding where it can be: forge
// recomputes this plan immediately before the write and refuses `--approve`
// for any other digest (checkPlanApproval), the promotion's compare-and-set
// still guards the pointer, and the approved digest is recorded beside the
// applied bundle on the apply gate.
