// WHERE THE §8.6 PLAN COMES FROM, and why the answer differs by backend.
//
//   - A CONTROL-PLANE env's plan comes from PlanDeploy, computed server-side
//     against the RECORDED bundle. That is not a performance choice. The
//     server recomputes the plan again at approval time, under the env row
//     lock, and refuses the write unless the digest matches — so the plan has
//     to be the server's, or the digest forge showed could never be the one
//     the server derives. Forge verifies the returned digest client-side
//     (hosted_plan.go), which catches a version skew now rather than as a
//     misleading plan_stale at approval time.
//   - A FILE-LEDGER env's plan is built HERE, by release.BuildPlan, because
//     there is no server. Both sides call the same function, so the two
//     backends cannot disagree about what a finding means — only about what
//     Live is, which is the thing they genuinely see differently.
//
// THE LIVE SIDE IS THE APPLIED BUNDLE, NEVER THE DECLARED SHAPE (briefing
// §7). `forge env build` refreshes declared_shape from the very render being
// deployed, so diffing against it would hide every change — the plan would
// report "no differences" precisely when there were some. For a self-managed
// env the applied bundle is the newest one with a SUCCEEDED apply; when there
// is none, Live is nil, which BuildPlan reports as an `unknown` warn rather
// than as an empty diff (F-20: empty and unknown must never render alike).

// planForDeploy is the plan a deploy of (env, version) is judged against.

// It resolves the bundle the deploy will apply — the newest one recorded for
// this env and this release — and plans against it.
//
// NEWEST FOR (env, release), because that is what a deploy of that release
// applies. A release is env-agnostic and a bundle is not, so one release has
// one bundle per env; re-running `forge env build` for the same release after
// a KCL edit records a second, and the newest is the one the next deploy ships.
//
// EVERY FAILURE HERE IS NON-FATAL, and that is the deliberate shape. The plan
// INFORMS the gate; it is not the gate. A deploy whose plan could not be
// computed still faces the confirmation prompt, still cannot proceed without
// approval, and — on a control plane — is still judged server-side at the
// write. Refusing the deploy because the plan was unavailable would make every
// transient read failure an outage, and the one thing a missing plan must not
// do is let a stop finding through silently, which gateDeployOnPlan handles by
// refusing --approve rather than by admitting the write.

// bundleDigestForRelease is the digest of the bundle a deploy of (env,

//
// IT READS THE MACHINE LEDGER FOR BOTH BACKENDS, which is a real limitation
// and not an oversight. A bundle is content-addressed, so its digest is a
// property of the bytes rather than of the store that indexes them — and the
// build that pushed a hosted env's bundle recorded the same digest locally on
// its way out. So the lookup works for a deploy run from the machine that
// built it, which is every deploy today.
//
// What it does NOT cover is a deploy from a DIFFERENT machine than the build:
// CI builds, an operator deploys. There the local ledger has no row, this
// returns "", and the deploy proceeds with no plan — gated by the confirmation
// and, on a control plane, still judged server-side at the write.
//
// The fix is a server-side lookup by (env, release), which needs an RPC that
// does not exist yet: GetBundle takes an id or a digest, and ListBundles is
// not in the doc's §6.3 list at all. Raised with the orchestrator rather than
