// The RELEASE half of `forge env deploy <env> [vX | --from <src-env>]` (ADR
// docs/adr/env-verbs.md, task V3). Was promote.go, reached as
// `forge env deploy <env> <version>`.
//
// WHAT THIS HALF DOES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. It reads the release
// `forge env build --release` cut, freezes each image's digest, and APPENDS one
// entry to the env's promotion ledger — the project's
// .forge/promotions/<env>.jsonl, or the control plane the env's KCL declares.
// No build runs; the bytes that were cut as <version> are, by construction,
// the bytes the env will run. It ships NOTHING: the apply and the health gate
// are the other half of the verb, in deploy_promote_follow.go.
//
// Keeping the ledger write separate from the apply is what makes the invariant
// "the bytes that passed staging ARE the bytes in prod" checkable — the
// digests are frozen the moment the env is promoted, independent of any later
// edit or move of the release file, and independent of whether the apply
// succeeded.
