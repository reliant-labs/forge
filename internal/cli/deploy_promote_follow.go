// The APPLY and the WAIT halves of `forge env deploy <env> vX` (ADR
// docs/adr/env-verbs.md, task V3). Was promote_wait.go, where the same
// machinery was reached by `promote --wait` / `--deploy`.
//
// WHY THESE ARE NO LONGER FLAGS. A promote moves a pointer and ships nothing,
// which is exactly right as a primitive and exactly wrong as the thing a
// person or a pipeline asks for. "Deploy prod to v1.4.0" that only recorded a
// binding reported success before any byte moved, and the release's actual
// failure surfaced minutes later with nothing connecting the two. Every
// pipeline therefore spelled it `promote --deploy --wait`, and the spellings
// that omitted either half were bugs waiting for an incident. So `deploy`
// means record + apply + wait, and the only flag left is the one that opts
// OUT (--no-wait).
//
// WHO APPLIES IS DECIDED BY THE LEDGER, NOT A FLAG. That is the whole of the
// hosted/self-managed parity the ADR asks for:
//
//   - A HOSTED env (its KCL declares forge.ControlPlane, so its promotions
//     live on that control plane) is converged server-side. forge applies
//     nothing; it waits on the rollout the control plane computes.
//   - A SELF-MANAGED env (promotions in .forge/promotions/<env>.jsonl) has
//     nothing watching its ledger, so this same command performs the ordinary
//     client-side render+apply against the binding it just wrote. There, the
//     apply's own per-resource rollout wait IS the health wait — there is no
//     server-computed rollout to poll, and `forge env status --wait` says so
//     rather than timing out.
//
// A control-plane LEDGER does not by itself mean the control plane converges
// anything: an env that declares forge.ControlPlane but binds no tier to it
// (control-plane's own prod) is applied entirely from here, exactly like a
// self-managed one. followPromote's table below has that row.
//
// Both reach "the release is live or this command is red", which is the
// property a caller can rely on. Which machinery got there is an
// implementation detail of where the env is run.
//
// THE HOSTED WAIT IS PINNED TO THE PROMOTION THIS COMMAND WROTE, not to
// "whatever is current". The distinction is the whole value. If the wait
// re-read the env's current promotion, a hotfix landing in the seconds after
// this deploy would silently become the thing being waited on, and the
// pipeline would report its own release as healthy on the strength of
// somebody else's. plan.Recorded carries the id the ledger returned, so the
// wait is pinned to it and an overtaking promote is reported as SUPERSEDED
// (exit 6) rather than passing.

//	HOSTED-ONLY  (Hosted)       apply nothing; wait on the rollout the control
//	                            plane computes.
//	MIXED        (Hosted+Mixed) BOTH. Apply the cluster/compose/infra half from
//	                            here, then wait on the hosted half.
//	LEDGER-ONLY  (Mixed, no     apply from here, and that is all: the control
//	              HostedTiers)  plane records the promotion and converges
//	                            nothing, so there is no hosted half to wait on.
//
// The mixed row is why "hosted" alone cannot decide this. A control plane
// converges only what it hosts, so an env with cluster workloads beside its
// hosted ones ships nothing from those workloads unless this command applies
// them — and a deploy that recorded, waited on the hosted rollout, and reported
// the release live while the cluster half still ran the previous one is exactly
