// What a hosted-ledger env's CONTROL PLANE will converge of
// `forge env deploy <env> <version>` — decided from the declaration and one
// read of the control plane BEFORE anything is written — and the check, after
// the publish, that the control plane agrees with what it was just sent.
//
// ── The incident this is shaped by (2026-10-09) ──────────────────────────────
//
// `forge env deploy prod 20261009.205925-d29da50b` against control-plane's
// prod: a forge.ControlPlane ledger over sixteen cluster workloads and one
// Firebase frontend, with NO hosted tier. The deploy recorded the promotion,
// applied every cluster workload from this machine (their new ReplicaSets
// were created at 21:30:41Z), built and shipped the frontend to Firebase
// Hosting — ten minutes of work, all of it live — and only THEN exited 2:
// "prod has no published workloads, so its control plane has nothing to
// converge and this release would never roll out … nothing shipped".
//
// Every clause was false for prod. Its control plane converges none of it BY
// DECLARATION, so an empty server-side rollout was the correct answer, not a
// missing publish; and this command's own apply was the whole deploy, already
// finished. The control plane's converger was never involved.
//
// Two defects, fixed separately:
//
//  1. THE PREDICATE. "No workload in the rollout" means "unpublished" only for
//     an env that binds tiers to its control plane. An env with none
//     (envLedger.ledgerOnly) has nothing there by construction: its follow-
//     through neither waits on a server-side rollout nor checks one.
//  2. THE ORDER. Whether the control plane will have anything to converge is
//     knowable before the deploy starts — from the declared hosted tiers, the
//     flags, and the control plane's list of published workloads — so it is
//     decided here, as part of the plan, before the promotion is recorded and
//     before any apply or frontend dispatch. A refused deploy writes nothing
//     and ships nothing, and `--plan` / `--plan-only` show the same verdict.
//
// ── When "nothing to converge" is genuine ────────────────────────────────────
//
// The converger only moves the digest on deployments that already exist; it
// creates none (control-plane internal/deployconverge/doc.go). A version
// deploy PUBLISHES the env's hosted tiers itself (O-15: the pure arm through
// applyHostedPublish, the mixed arm inside its local apply), so after O-15 the
// refusal is reserved for the deploy that will NOT publish them — its flags
// keep it from doing so (--dry-run applies nothing; --frontends-only publishes
// only frontends) — against an env whose control plane holds none of them
// yet. The refusal names every such tier and the flag responsible.
