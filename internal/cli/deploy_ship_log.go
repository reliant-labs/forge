// What a deploy has CHANGED on a live target so far, so that a deploy which
// fails part-way reports what it shipped instead of claiming it shipped
// nothing.
//
// A deploy is a sequence of side effects against independent targets: the
// cluster apply, the control-plane publish, each frontend host. A failure in a
// later one does not undo an earlier one — there is no rollback, recovery is
// roll forward — so "the deploy failed" and "nothing shipped" are different
// facts. On 2026-10-09 a prod deploy applied sixteen cluster workloads and
// shipped its Firebase frontend, failed afterwards, and printed "nothing
// shipped". The run before it had done the same with the stages reversed in
// outcome: the cluster apply landed, the Firebase step failed for want of the
// `firebase` binary, and the ledger recorded the whole apply as FAILED while
// its images were serving traffic.
//
// The log is threaded through deployOptions the way deployReport is, and every
// method is nil-safe, so a caller that does not ask (a dry run, `forge env up`)
// runs the identical code path and records nothing.
