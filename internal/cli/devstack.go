A launcher (Taskfile target, bootstrap script) that starts a host process

allocate. 'forge env devstack port' resolves it through the same lock-guarded
block registry (.forge/blocks.json) the forge.allocate_port KCL builtin uses,
so the launcher and the render can never drift.

On the PRIMARY checkout the worktree key is "" so every port is returned
unchanged (block 0) — the default dev loop is byte-identical to today. A
linked git worktree gets its own stable 100-port block.

This is the diagnostic view, and showing everything is the point. The ceiling
(dev_stack.max_stacks) counts BLOCKS, so a plain port-block key consumes the
cluster's pre-mapped host-port range exactly as a worktree does. This command
used to print only worktree stacks, which meant a reader who hit "8-block
ceiling" and ran it saw ONE line accounting for eight blocks — the command
recommended by the error message contradicted the error message.

Three kinds of holder are labelled, and the label says whether prune can ever
reclaim it:

  dev stack            the key IS a worktree name. Reclaimable once that
                       worktree is gone.
  derived port-block   the key was COMPOSED from a worktree, e.g. "prod-wt-x"
                       from 'fp.allocate_port(3000, "prod-" + option("worktree"))'.
                       Reclaimable once that worktree is gone; the origin
                       worktree is named in the label.
  standalone           tied to no worktree (e.g. "prod", allocated from the
                       primary checkout). NEVER reclaimable — nothing on disk
                       can make it dead, and reclaiming it would move a live
                       stack's port.

--stacks-only restores the old output: just the DEV-STACK keys, one per line,
no labels. That is the machine-readable roster a per-stack config generator
consumes, and it must stay strictly stacks: a generator that enumerated the raw
registry and treated every key as a worktree emitted a dev NATS account for a
prod web port into a tracked config file. Those keys are the EXACT values
option("worktree") renders to in KCL, so a generator's per-key derivation (NATS
user/password, DB name, …) can be made byte-identical to the KCL's.

The DEFAULT stack (the primary checkout, key "") is shown in the full listing
when it holds an entry, and is never included in --stacks-only — a generator
always emits the default's config itself.

Inside KCL, prefer the fp.dev_stacks() builtin over shelling out to this
command: it returns the same roster during the render (and EMPTY when forge
generate / forge ci render without one). Write the generated file with
fp.write_file(path, content), not KCL's file.write: file.write fires on every
evaluation, so ci, lint, doctor and env render would rewrite it from whatever
roster they saw; fp.write_file writes only on forge env up and an applying
forge env deploy of a local env.`,

		Long: `Reclaim entries in the block registry (.forge/blocks.json) for git
worktrees that have been removed from disk.

Nothing is ever removed from this registry automatically — a deleted
worktree's block stays held forever unless something reclaims it. Blocks are
DENSE and the reachable range is finite (see dev_stack.max_stacks in
forge.yaml, default 8), so leaked entries from old worktrees are exactly how
a project runs out of dev stacks.

What gets reclaimed: any entry TIED TO A WORKTREE that no longer appears in
'git worktree list --porcelain'. Two kinds of entry are tied to one:
  - A DEV-STACK key (one per git worktree, e.g. "wt-feature-x") — the key is
    the worktree's name.
  - A DERIVED port-block key — one COMPOSED from a worktree, e.g.
    'fp.allocate_port(3000, "prod-" + option("worktree"))' allocating
    "prod-wt-feature-x". The origin worktree is recorded when the block is
    allocated, so reclaiming never has to guess it from the key's name.

What is NEVER reclaimed, no matter how "dead" it looks:
  - The default key "" (block 0) — the primary checkout's implicit block.
  - A STANDALONE port-block key — e.g. "prod", which prod's reliant-web
    dev-server port allocates under on the primary checkout, where there is
    no worktree to derive from. It is tied to no worktree at all, so it can
    never legitimately look dead; reclaiming one would silently move a live,
    running stack's port. This is the single most important correctness
    property of this command, and it is why the distinction is drawn from
    what forge RECORDED at allocation rather than from how composed the key
    looks: "prod" and "prod-wt-x" are indistinguishable by shape.
  - An entry allocated by a forge older than the origin field, until the next
    render from its own worktree records where it came from. Leaving such a
    block held is the deliberately safe failure: a held block wastes a slot,
    while a wrongly-moved port breaks a k3d host mapping and the dev IdP's
    baked-in issuer.

If enumerating live worktrees fails for any reason (git missing, this isn't
a git checkout, the git command errors), prune reclaims NOTHING and reports
the failure — deleting a block that might actually still be live would move
a running stack's ports.

Freeing a block lets the NEXT new worktree take it (blocks are filled
densely, lowest free index first), so pruning is what keeps the block range
from being exhausted by worktrees nobody remembers to clean up.

By default this only PRINTS what would be reclaimed and changes nothing —
pass --apply to actually rewrite the registry. This mutates machine-local
state that other running dev stacks depend on (a concurrent 'forge env up'
is briefly locked out while the rewrite happens), so making it opt-in to
apply is the safer default for a command most people will run interactively
to see what's accumulated.

This is the manual counterpart to 'prune'. Prune reclaims blocks forge can
PROVE are dead — a dev stack or a derived port-block key whose worktree is gone
— and will never touch an entry it has no evidence for. Release is for those
remaining entries: typically blocks allocated before forge recorded which
worktree a key came from, whose worktree was deleted before it could ever be
recorded. 'forge env devstack prune' lists them.

forge cannot make this call itself. A key composed from a worktree
("prod-wt-x") and a standalone key ("prod") are indistinguishable by name once
the worktree is gone, and the two possible mistakes are not equally bad:
leaving a block held wastes one slot of dev_stack.max_stacks, while releasing a
live one moves that stack's ports — invalidating its k3d host-port mapping and
the dev IdP's baked-in 'iss' claim and redirect URIs, which surfaces much later
as an unrelated-looking failure.

So only release a key when you know which worktree it belonged to and that the
worktree is gone. If a listed key matches a worktree that still exists, leave
it: the next render from that worktree records its origin, after which prune
handles it automatically.

Releasing frees the block for the next new key (blocks fill densely, lowest
free index first).

By default this only PRINTS what it would do — pass --apply to rewrite.
