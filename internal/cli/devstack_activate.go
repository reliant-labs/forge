// activateDevStack arms the render-context globals BEFORE the first render so
// that every render path (entity AND manifest) sees the same parallel-dev-
// stack inputs under BOTH `forge env up` and `forge env deploy`:
//
//   - devstack.SetActive — pushes option("worktree") + option("branch") into
//     KCL (the raw git facts; the KCL author decides which to key on).
//   - kclplugin.UseBlockAllocator — backs forge.allocate_port(base, key) with
//     the lock-guarded, persistent block registry (.forge/blocks.json), so a
//     keyed port resolves to the SAME deterministic base+block*100 under up
//     and deploy. This is the up-vs-deploy port fix, now via the block
//     registry instead of a per-instance port store.
//   - kclplugin.UsePortStore — keeps the GENERAL resolve_port primitive
//     stable across runs and identical under up/deploy via the historical
//     .forge/ports-<env>.json store (resolve_port is still availability-
//     stepping, so its store remains the source of truth).
//
// Dev IdP identity is NOT armed here. There is no render-time resolver for
// it: the `idp-provision` job (deploy/kcl/workloads.k, run as an ordinary
// one-shot alongside every other job) converges the registration and
// PUBLISHES the result — a ConfigMap on a cluster target, a committed KCL
// file on compose/dev — and every render simply reads whatever was last
// published. See the `auth/dev-loop` skill.
//
// It returns a restore func that reverts the port store to its pre-render
// bytes — the up path calls it when its already-running guard rejects a
// render, so a rejected attempt can't drift the stable resolve_port
// assignments. Deploy ignores it (an applied render's values ARE the truth).
//
// On the primary checkout with no worktree, option("worktree") is "" so a
// KCL that keys on it composes the DEFAULT stack — historical names and
// allocate_port(base, "") == base — byte-identical to before this primitive.
//
// purpose decides WHICH ports the render is about — see renderPurpose. A
// render of an env that runs nowhere on this machine arms none of the WRITING
// halves: allocate_port resolves to its base port and resolve_port reads its
// store without writing it.
//
// claim decides whether the render may REGISTER anything — see blockClaim. A
// read-only command (render, config, status, deploy --dry-run) resolves the
// blocks its keys already hold and never hands out a new one, so it can
// neither leak a block nor fail at the dev_stack.max_stacks ceiling.
