// newDoctorCmd builds `forge doctor` — "is this PROJECT healthy and
// well-formed", and nothing else.
//
// Doctor used to straddle two questions and take a `--env string (default
// "dev")` for the second one, so running it in a project silently reported
// on an environment the user never named. Worse, it answered that half
// badly: `App Health` guessed the app was on :8080, missed a project serving
// on :3091, and rendered the miss as a gray dash — indistinguishable from
// "not applicable".
//
// The runtime half now belongs to `forge env status <env>`, which already
// resolves the ports `forge env up` actually bound and reports holder pid,
// forge-ownership, build freshness and duplicate servers on top. There is
// one resolver for "what port does this component serve on", and it is not
// in doctor. What remains here spans EVERY declared environment, needs
// nothing running, and is therefore answerable in CI.
func newDoctorCmd() *cobra.Command {
	var (
		jsonOutput bool
		verbose    bool
		timeout    time.Duration
		signal     string
	)

	cmd := &cobra.Command{
		Use: "doctor",
		// A stray positional used to run the full suite and exit 0. Doctor
		// takes no arguments; a typo must fail rather than be swallowed.
		Args:  cobra.NoArgs,
		Short: "Check that the PROJECT is well-formed (deployability, payload caps, tooling, cluster capability)",
		Long: `Check that this project is healthy and well-formed.

Everything doctor checks is answerable from the project's own artefacts,
across every declared environment, with nothing running:

  * deployability of the rendered manifests — probes, resource requests
    and limits, credentials sourced from Secrets, ServiceAccounts bound to
    pods, a way to apply pending migrations,
  * Connect payload caps,
  * disowned generated files and dead forge.yaml keys,
  * the host tools forge shells out to (and their minimum versions),
  * cluster CAPABILITY: does the cluster carry the GatewayClass /
    ClusterIssuer this project's manifests require.

Doctor takes no --env, because it never asks about one.

For "is the stack for environment X up and reachable" — the app's
/healthz, pprof, the compose infra, the telemetry backends, Delve — use:

  forge env status <env>                 # host services + frontends + runtime checks
  forge env status <env> --signal traces # one signal only

That command resolves the ports the stack actually bound (rather than
guessing a default), and reports the holder pid, whether the process is
forge-owned, whether its build is stale against HEAD, and whether two
processes are serving one service.

Examples:
  forge doctor                  # Check the project
  forge doctor --json           # Machine-readable output
  forge doctor --verbose        # Show evidence for passing checks
  forge doctor --signal deploy  # Deployability gate only (the CI arm)`,
