// `forge env build <env>` is where an environment's artifacts are produced:
// built, optionally pushed, and — with --release — recorded as an immutable
// release.
//
// WHY THE SPLIT. Pushing and cutting a release are ENVIRONMENT acts. Both need
// an env to be meaningful at all: a push destination is declared per workload
// in the env's render (resolvePushPlan), and a release's artifact SET is
// discovered from deploy/kcl/<env>/main.k, including the per-env external
// build_cmd images that exist nowhere else. `forge env build --push` and
// `forge env build --release` therefore both already REQUIRED an env argument
// while living on a command whose env was optional — the flag combination
// `forge env build --push` with no env was a usage error that could only be
// reported at runtime, and `forge env build --release` without one silently built
// an incomplete set until a guard was added for it.
//
// So the env moves from an optional modifier to the command's subject, and the
// two flags move with it. Top-level `forge build` keeps what genuinely needs
// no env — compiling — and refuses the two flags with a pointer here (see
// refuseBuildPublishFlag in build.go).
//
// `forge release cut` folded into this command as `--release <v> --no-build`:
// it was the cut WITHOUT the build, for the pipeline shape where build and
// release are separate jobs. That is this command with the build phase off,
// reading the digests the earlier push already recorded in .forge/state — one
// code path for "cut a release", differing only in whether it builds first.

	cmd := &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "build <environment>",
		Short: "Build an environment's artifacts; --push publishes them, --release records an immutable release",
		Args:  cobra.ExactArgs(1),
		Long: `Build the artifacts an environment declares.

Iterates the workloads deploy/kcl/<env>/ declares and dispatches on each
one's build.type — go, docker, shell, remote — exactly as the compile-only
` + "`forge build`" + ` does. What this command adds is everything that needs
an environment to mean anything:

  --push          publish each image to the reference ITS OWN workload
                  declares (its image field in deploy/kcl/workloads.k) — the
                  same reference ` + "`forge env deploy`" + ` reads, so what is
                  pushed is what is deployed. Two workloads may name two
                  different registries; both are pushed. Takes no value and
                  carries no registry.

  --release vX    record an IMMUTABLE RELEASE: capture every artifact's digest
                  into a release ledger (.forge/releases/vX.json, or the
                  control plane when the env declares one).
                  IMPLIES --push — a release pins registry-addressable
                  digests, and a local tag cannot be promoted anywhere.

A release is build-once → promote: ` + "`forge env deploy <env> vX`" + ` pins the
SAME digests in every environment, with no per-env rebuild. The images are
env-agnostic; the env argument supplies the artifact SET to build and the
registries to push to, so pick any env that declares the full set.

CUTTING WITHOUT REBUILDING. In a pipeline where the build and the release are
separate jobs, pass --no-build with --release: the digests an earlier
` + "`--push`" + ` recorded in .forge/state are harvested and the release is
recorded without rebuilding anything. Rebuilding to cut would be exactly the
rebuild the release model exists to avoid.

  forge env build prod --push                  # job 1: build and push
  forge env build prod --release v1.4.0 --no-build   # job 2: record the release
  forge env deploy prod v1.4.0                 # bind prod to it

Re-cutting the same version over the same artifacts is a no-op; over
DIFFERENT artifacts it is refused. The cut FAILS if anything the env declares
is missing from the ledger — a release with a hole in it promotes like a
complete one and ships an environment that is missing a piece.

--release owns the image tag (it IS the release version), so a conflicting
--tag is refused: a release build pushes under the release version only, so a
cut that fails part-way can never leave a shared, mutable tag pointing at
bytes no release contains.

Examples:
  forge env build dev                          # build the env's artifacts
  forge env build prod --push                  # build + push to declared registries
  forge env build prod --release v1.4.0        # build + push + record the release
  forge env build prod --release v1.4.0 --plan # preflight the cut, build nothing
  forge env build prod --target api --push     # scope to one workload`,
		// A build failure, a registry rejection or an incomplete release are
		// not usage errors; a cobra flag dump after one buries the message
		// that says what to do.
