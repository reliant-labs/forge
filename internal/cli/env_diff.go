// `forge env diff <env>|--all` — the What-if primitive (doc §8), which the
// UI calls Preview.
//
// It renders a checkout and diffs each env's shape against Live. The whole
// comparison is a SET DIFF over per-object hashes, which is why a shape
// carries one hash per object: no manifest is fetched or parsed, and the
// diff itself is under 10ms. The cost is the render.
//
// WHY IT RENDERS IN PLACE, in the selected checkout, rather than into a
// snapshot (§8.3). A `git archive <tree>` into a temp dir would be far
// easier to reason about and it RENDERS WRONG: KCL resolves sibling
// checkouts by relative path — control-plane's dev render runs host
// processes from `../reliant` — and from a temp dir `../reliant` does not
// exist. A diff computed against a render that silently lost its siblings is
// worse than no diff.
//
// So it renders in place, under three guards, and each one has a per-env
// status rather than a global failure (F-8). A partial diff that hid a
// failure would read as "no changes", which is the single most dangerous
// thing this command could say:
//
//  1. NO WRITES. The render runs with the existing write-watch armed. forge
//     cannot promise purity — KCL evaluates `file.write` during evaluation
//     and there is no hook to suppress a project's own writes — so a render
//     that wrote anything is reported `impure` WITH THE PATHS and its result
//     is discarded. What-if must never modify a user's worktree.
//  2. A TREE-HASH BRACKET. The tree hash is taken before and after. If it
//     moved, the user was editing while we rendered, the result describes
//     neither state, and the env is `stale` — retried once, because the
//     common case is a single save landing mid-render.
//  3. CAPABILITY. A forge that cannot render (the CGO-free build has no KCL
//     plugin) says so in forge's own words, per env, and the picker stays
//     usable for Live.
//
// THE LIVE SIDE IS THE APPLIED BUNDLE, NOT declared_shape, and the order
// matters: `current_bundle.shape`, else `declared_shape`, else nothing
// recorded. `forge env build` REFRESHES declared_shape from the very render
// being deployed, so an env that has been built since its last deploy would
// diff against its own candidate and report no changes — hiding exactly what
// the user opened Preview to see. declared_shape is the fallback for
// pre-bundle history only, and an env with neither is reported as "no
// recorded config", never as "everything is added".

what is actually deployed. READ-ONLY: no cluster is contacted, no image is
built, nothing is pushed.

WHAT IS COMPARED. Shapes, not manifests — the diff is a set comparison over
one hash per rendered object, so it needs no YAML. You get: objects added,
removed and changed (with image changes split out from config changes),
workloads added and removed, runtime and cluster moves, secrets newly needed,
and domain changes.

THE LIVE SIDE is the last recorded BUNDLE's shape — what was actually
deployed. An environment with no bundle yet falls back to its declared shape,
and one with neither is reported as "no recorded config" rather than as
"everything is new". The report says which, because a diff against a declared
shape is weaker evidence than one against an applied bundle.

THREE GUARDS, each with a PER-ENVIRONMENT status. A failure never silently
reads as "no changes":

  ok           the render succeeded, wrote nothing, and the tree held still
  impure       the render wrote files; the paths are listed and the result is
               discarded
  stale        the tree changed while rendering (you were editing); retried once
  error        the render failed; forge's message is included
