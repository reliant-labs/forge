// `forge env status [environment...]` — THE one read view of an environment
// (ADR docs/adr/env-verbs.md, task V4).
//
// WHY ONE COMMAND. Reading an environment used to take six verbs — `env
// status`, `env verify`, `env wait`, `env rollout`, `env topology`, `env
// history` — and they were views of a single question, split by which half of
// the answer each happened to own. A reader had to know, before they could
// ask, that the bound release lived in `verify`, the rollout phase in
// `rollout`, the runtime ports in `status`, and the promotion that caused all
// of it in `history`. Worse, two of the six were literal duplicates:
// `env rollout` WAS `env wait --timeout 0`.
//
// So they are modes of one command now, and the modes are the questions a
// reader actually has:
//
//	forge env status              every environment (the old `env topology`)
//	forge env status prod         prod, right now: runtime AND release
//	forge env status prod --wait  block until the rollout settles (old `env wait`)
//	forge env status prod --history  what has prod run (old `env history`)
//
// EACH MODE REACHES THE SAME CODE THE DELETED VERB CALLED. Nothing was
// reimplemented in the move: --wait is runEnvWait, --history is runEnvHistory,
// the all-envs view is runEnvTopology, and the release half is the old
// verify's runEnvStatusRelease. That is what makes "every exit code is
// unchanged" a property of the wiring rather than a promise.
//
// EXIT CODES COME FROM THE HALF THAT OWNS THEM, and the one subtlety worth
// knowing is that the two halves of the default view are NOT symmetric:
//
//   - The RUNTIME half reports and never fails. "The app is down" is a state
//     this command must be able to print — a status verb that exited non-zero
//     for it would be unusable as the one read view, and the runtime checks
//     have always had that contract.
//   - The RELEASE half's verdict IS the command's exit code (0 / 1 / 2),
//     because that half makes a CLAIM: the env is or is not running what it
//     declares. 1 is "we looked and it is wrong", 2 is "we could not look".
//
// --wait keeps 0/1/5/6/2 and --history keeps 0/1/2, both untouched.

WHAT ONE ENV'S REPORT CARRIES:

  * the BOUND RELEASE — the version this env's promotion ledger declares, and
    when it was promoted (promote time, NOT deploy time; that gap is what the
    verify half exists to measure);
  * VERIFY — the digests the env is actually RUNNING against the ones the
    binding froze, per declared image, in five states: match / drift /
    missing / untagged / unreachable. A hosted env is read through its
    control plane's observer, because forge cannot read a hosted cluster;
  * the ROLLOUT PHASE per workload, as the control plane computes it;
  * RUNTIME HEALTH — every host service and frontend with its URL, log file
    and whether a listener is accepting right now, plus the compose infra,
    the app's /healthz + /readyz, pprof and the telemetry backends;
  * GATES — the evidence recorded for the current promotion;
  * LEDGER FRESHNESS — whether this checkout's copy of the promotion log is
    the newest one;
  * RECORDS — the PROVENANCE of the bound release (tree, commit, branch,
    dirty) and how the binding was made; the CONVERGENCE of it (what the
    reconciler did, onto which bundle, when it was observed); and the LOCAL
    SESSIONS running it.

CONVERGENCE IS AN OBSERVATION, NOT FORGE'S REPORT. forge never applies to a
cluster — a reconciler converges each environment to its promoted bundle — so
this is read from the environment's control plane and labelled as what the
control plane observed. An environment with no control plane has no reconciler
and shows one plain line saying so. If a control plane has not reported yet,
the report says that rather than inventing a state.

RECORDS DESCRIBE, THEY DO NOT JUDGE. An unreadable records store never
changes the exit code — the cluster comparison above already has an opinion
about whether the bytes landed. An environment with no records shows the empty
state plainly, which is an answer, never an error.

LOCAL SESSIONS are PRESENCE ONLY: one row per worktree per machine, recorded
best-effort by ` + "`forge env up`" + `, and never a promotion, a deploy target or an
input to policy or billing. A record nothing refreshes is discarded after 24h,
so a crashed stack simply goes quiet — shown as "quiet", not as failed, because
forge cannot tell a crash from a closed laptop. Only LOCAL environments have
sessions; for any other kind the report says so rather than showing an empty
list, since "no sessions" and "sessions do not apply here" are different facts.

THE TWO HALVES ARE NOT SYMMETRIC ABOUT FAILURE, on purpose. Runtime health
REPORTS: "the app is down" is a state this command must be able to print, so
it never changes the exit code. The release half makes a CLAIM — the env is or
is not running what it declares — so its verdict is the exit code.

` + "`--wait`" + ` blocks until the rollout of a promotion finishes, and reports whether
it STAYED up past the stability window. It is pinned to ONE promotion, never
to "whatever the env declares now", so a hotfix promoted mid-wait reports
SUPERSEDED rather than succeeding on bytes it was never asked about.
` + "`--wait --timeout 0`" + ` reads the phase ONCE and never blocks.

` + "`--history`" + ` pages the promotion ledger with a keyset cursor: pass the previous
page's ` + "`next_before`" + ` as --before, and stop on an EMPTY next_before rather than
on a short page.

EXIT CODES — a pipeline branches on these directly:

  0  everything declared is running (or nothing is declared)
  1  we looked and it is WRONG — an image drifted or is missing; with --wait,
     a workload is DEGRADED
  2  we could not DETERMINE — a cluster or control plane was unreachable, a
     credential was refused, the thing is unobservable, or this checkout's
     promotion ledger is stale
  5  --wait only: TIMED OUT while still pending / progressing / stabilizing.
     The rollout was progressing, so retry the wait; do not re-promote
  6  --wait only: SUPERSEDED — a newer promotion replaced the one waited on

1 and 2 are separate because CI must tell a bad release from a broken control
plane; a gate that reports both with one code gets switched off the first week
it is wrong about one of them. 5 and 6 are deliberately not 1: "we never saw
this finish" and "the release was overtaken" are not "the release is bad".

A STALE FILE LEDGER IS EXIT 2. .forge/promotions/<env>.jsonl is committed to
git, so a checkout that has not pulled compares the cluster against an OLDER
promotion — a fine deploy reads as DRIFT, and a deploy that never happened can
read as MATCH. Neither is evidence, so the verdict is "could not determine"
with the fix. AHEAD (a release recorded here, not yet merged) is noted, not
failed.

--json emits ONE document with the same verdict and IDENTICAL exit codes;
` + "`ok`" + ` is false exactly when the process exits non-zero.

Examples:
  forge env status                                  # the whole topology, offline
  forge env status prod                             # did prod receive its release?
  forge env status prod --wait                      # gate a release on the rollout
  forge env status prod --wait --timeout 0 --json   # where is it NOW? one read
  forge env status prod --history --limit 1 --json | jq -r '.promotions[0].id'
  forge env status prod --json | jq -r '.images[] | select(.state == "drift")'`

// newEnvStatusCmd is `forge env status [environment...]`.
//
// The env is OPTIONAL — that is the one arity change the merge makes, and it
// is what absorbs the old `env topology`: with no env there is nothing to
