// The RECORDS half of `forge env status <env>` (doc §6.3, §7.4, §13): where
// what is bound came FROM, what the reconciler did with it, and which local
// stacks are running it.
//
// WHY THIS BELONGS IN env status AND NOT A NEW VERB. The command already
// answers "is this env running what it declares" by comparing a binding
// against a cluster. These three are the facts a reader needs the moment that
// answer is interesting: a DRIFT whose cause is a convergence that failed is a
// different problem from one whose cause is a bad release, and a reader who
// has to run a second command to tell them apart will not.
//
// FORGE NEVER APPLIES, SO IT NEVER REPORTS AN APPLY. A reconciler converges
// each env to its promoted bundle, and what succeeded is a SECONDARY
// OBSERVATION written by the control plane's observer. So the convergence
// shown here is read from the control plane and labelled as its observation;
// forge contributes no apply record of its own, and this file deliberately
// ignores the fields that carry forge-written ones. An env with no control
// plane has no reconciler, and says so in one line rather than showing an
// empty apply that would read as "nothing has deployed".
//
// IT NEVER CHANGES THE VERDICT, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING. Every exit code
// this command returns is computed by envStatusReleaseVerdict from the
// binding and the cluster, exactly as before. Records are DESCRIPTION: a
// failed convergence is not an error here (the cluster comparison already has
// an opinion about whether the bytes landed), an unreachable records backend
// is not an error (it says so and the verdict stands), and an env with no
// records at all prints an empty state and exits 0. A records read that could
// fail the command would make `forge env status` depend on a control plane
// being reachable to answer a question about a local cluster.
//
// EMPTY IS NOT UNKNOWN, and the two are rendered differently throughout. "no
// apply recorded" is an answer; "could not read the records" is not. The
// §7.4 rule that a surface must distinguish "no sessions" from "cannot see
// sessions" is the same rule — a view that collapses them tells a user their
// stack is down when really their ledger could not be opened.
