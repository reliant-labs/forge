// The RELEASE half of `forge env status <env>`: is this environment actually
// RUNNING the release its binding claims?
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE QUESTION FROM RUNTIME HEALTH. A promotion writes a
// binding — env → release, with the per-image digests frozen at promote time
// — and `promoted_at` is stamped when the env is PROMOTED, not when it is
// deployed. Cutting a release is not shipping it, and a binding claiming
// v1.5.13 proves only that someone ran a promote. Confirming prod had moved
// used to mean reading live digests by hand, one
// `kubectl get deploy -o jsonpath` per workload. This is that check.
//
// It is the retired `env verify`, unchanged in substance: the same five
// outcomes, the same injected seams, and the same exit codes. Only the
// command surface moved — status is the one read view now, and this is the
// half of it that compares a declaration against reality.
//
// FIVE OUTCOMES, NOT TWO:
//
//	MATCH        the cluster runs the digest the binding declares.
//	DRIFT        the cluster runs a DIFFERENT digest. Both are reported.
//	MISSING      declared by the binding, running nowhere.
//	UNTAGGED     the workload runs by mutable tag, so there is no digest to
//	             compare. Nothing is proven either way.
//	UNREACHABLE  the cluster could not be read. Says NOTHING about the env.
//
// Exit 2 is separate from 1 on purpose. A VPN drop or an expired credential
// is not evidence that a release is wrong, and a gate that reports drift and
// a network failure with the same code gets switched off the first week it is
// wrong about one of them.
