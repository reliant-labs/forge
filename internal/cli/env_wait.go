// `forge env status <env> --wait`: the post-release health gate (control-plane
// docs/design/hosted-deploy-primitives.md §3.2, task F3).
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR, AND WHY IT IS NOT "POLL GetStatus UNTIL CONVERGED".
// Promote moves a pointer and deploy publishes bytes; neither answers the
// question a pipeline actually gates on — "is the release I just shipped
// serving traffic, and did it stay up?" Polling the environment verdict for
// that lies in five distinct ways, each of which would make the gate worse
// than no gate:
//
//  1. The verdict is not pinned to a promotion. A hotfix promoted while CI
//     waits moves the rows, and the wait then succeeds on bytes it was never
//     asked about.
//  2. A healthy mid-rollout reads DIVERGED, so failing on DIVERGED fails
//     every deploy and ignoring it hides real drift.
//  3. "Ready" can be true before any new pod serves: under RollingUpdate the
//     old ReplicaSet keeps readyReplicas up while the new one crash-loops.
//  4. Nothing distinguishes "finished" from "finished and stayed up" — a pod
//     that crash-loops 40 seconds after Ready passes.
//  5. Unobservable is not healthy, and must not fold into either answer.
//
// So the phase is computed ONCE, server-side, scoped to one promotion's
// frozen pins (GetRollout), and this verb reads it. `forge env deploy`'s
// readiness wait, the in-flight promote refusal and the UI read the same RPC,
// which is what stops four consumers holding four opinions about whether v6
// is done.
//
// THE EXIT CODES ARE THE CONTRACT. A pipeline branches on them directly, so
// the distinctions are load-bearing: 5 (timed out while progressing) says
// retry the WAIT, 6 (superseded) says this release was overtaken, 2 says we
// could not look, and only 1 says the release is wrong. Collapsing any of
// them into 1 fails builds for releases that were fine, which is how a gate
// gets switched off.
//
// DEFAULT IS NOT FAIL-FAST (owner ruling Q4). A pod that crash-loops once on
// a cold start and then settles is ordinary, and exiting on the first
// DEGRADED observation would make the gate flaky in exactly the way that
// destroys trust in it. The rollout fails when the DEADLINE passes while
// degraded, and the report says which observation it was. `--fail-fast` is
// for pipelines that prefer speed to tolerance.
