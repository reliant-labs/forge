// The exit-code table every hosted deploy verb shares.
//
// It extends the convention `forge release verify` and `forge env status`
// already follow, where the distinction that matters is not pass/fail but
// WHETHER WE LOOKED: 1 means "looked, and it is wrong", and 2 means "could
// not determine". That difference is what lets CI tell a bad release from a
// broken control plane, and collapsing the two into a generic failure is the
// thing this table exists to prevent.
//
// CI branches on these codes directly, which is why they are named here
// rather than written as literals at each `exitCodeError{code: …}`. A verb
// that invented its own numbering would silently change the meaning of a
// pipeline's `if [ $? -eq 3 ]`, and a reader of that pipeline has no way to
// discover the drift.
//
// 3–8 are the codes the hosted primitives add. Each names ONE outcome a
// pipeline reacts to differently:
//
//   - 3 (conflict) means someone else moved the environment. The pipeline
//     must stop and page a human: retrying would stomp whatever landed.
//   - 4 (refused) means the write was declined, not lost — a rollout is in
//     flight, or the environment is pinned. A pipeline may wait and retry.
//   - 5 (plan unconfirmed) means nobody approved the plan. Nothing was
//     written; the pipeline must add --yes (or approve interactively).
//   - 6 (superseded) means a newer promotion replaced the one being waited
//     on. The wait's subject is gone, so neither retry nor failure is right
//     — the pipeline's release was overtaken.
//   - 8 (timed out) means the rollout was still progressing when the budget
//     ran out. Retrying the WAIT is correct; re-promoting is not.
//
// 6 and 8 are deliberately NOT 1. A timeout and an overtaken wait are both
// "we never saw this finish", and reporting either as "the release is bad"
// would fail builds for releases that were fine.
//
// WHY 5 MOVED, AND WHY THAT IS THE RIGHT TRADE. 5 meant "the wait's budget
// expired" until O-13 gave `forge env deploy` a confirmation gate, which
// needed a code of its own for the one outcome a pipeline must never
// misread: nothing was deployed because nobody approved it. The two
// candidates were a NEW code for the gate, or a new code for the timeout.
//
// The gate took 5 because it is the one that must be impossible to confuse
// with success. A pipeline that upgrades without adding --yes now exits 5,
// and the worst available reading of 5 is "a wait timed out" — which also
// means "not deployed", so a stale handler still fails the job rather than
// passing it. Had the gate taken 8 instead, an old handler's `[ $? -eq 5 ]`
// → "retry the wait" branch would retry a deploy that had never been
// approved. Pre-1.0, so the renumber is a clean break rather than an alias:
// `forge env deploy --help`'s table is the contract, and
// internal/cli/exitcodes.go is the only place either number is written.
// Known consumer: reliant's internal/toolexec/daemonruntime/cmd_forge_deploy.go
// carries forge's exit code as DATA and branches on no specific value.
