// `forge gate record` / `forge gate list` — post-promote check evidence
// (control-plane docs/design/hosted-deploy-primitives.md §3.3).
//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES. Gates could only ever attach AT promote time, but the
// most important evidence about a promotion arrives after it: did the rollout
// converge, did the smoke pass, did a human sign it off. The promotion row is
// append-only, so none of that had anywhere to go, and the result was an
// evidence trail that stopped at the moment of least information.
//
// `gate record` is where it goes. A new append-only child table server-side,
// one row per (promotion, check, run) — so a re-run appends rather than
// overwrites, and the history of a flaky check is itself visible.
//
// WHY IT IS A TOP-LEVEL VERB AND NOT `forge env gate`. A gate is attached to
// a PROMOTION, not to an environment: the env is only how you find the
// promotion ("the current one"). Hanging it under `env` would imply the
// evidence moves when the env does, which is the opposite of what an
// append-only trail means.
//
// EXIT CODES (§3.3, and note what is NOT here):
//
//	0  recorded, or already recorded (idempotent)
//	1  invalid gate
//	2  unreachable, or auth refused
//	3  --release names a release that is not the env's current promotion
//
// RECORDING A `failed` GATE EXITS 0. The recording succeeded; that is what
// this command does. The check's own step already failed the job, and making
// `gate record` fail too would mean a pipeline that records evidence is
// strictly more likely to go red than one that stays silent — which is a
// direct incentive not to record. Evidence must be free to report bad news.

A gate is one check's result — lint, test, smoke, rollout, a manual
sign-off — recorded against the promotion it is evidence about. Gates are
EVIDENCE, NOT ENFORCEMENT: forge records what it is told and who told it,
and refuses nothing on a gate's status. What a recorded gate proves is
that this credential claimed this result at this time.

Two attachment points, because they answer different questions:

  forge env promote … --gate lint.json    what had passed BEFORE the
                                          environment moved (frozen into
                                          the promotion entry)
  forge gate record prod --from wait.json what was learned AFTER (appended
                                          to an append-only child record)

"Was this known before the button was pressed?" is the first question
asked about a bad release, and merging the two would lose it.

Recording needs deploy:write, which is deliberately weaker than promote:
a CI test job should be able to report its result without being able to
move production.`,

The gate comes from a document, or is stated inline:

  forge gate record prod --from wait.json
  forge gate record prod --from smoke.json
  forge gate record prod --name qa-signoff --status passed --summary "checked by sean"

--from reads a gate-shaped JSON document (what --gate-json writes) OR any
forge --json document, deriving the check's name, verdict and summary from
it. So every forge verb that can judge something is recordable with no glue
script:

  forge env wait prod --json  > wait.json   && forge gate record prod --from wait.json
  forge env smoke prod --json > smoke.json  && forge gate record prod --from smoke.json
  forge lint --gate-json lint.json          && forge gate record prod --from lint.json

By default the gate attaches to the environment's CURRENT promotion. Name a
specific one with --promotion, or assert which release you believe is current
with --release: if the environment has moved on, that exits 3 rather than
recording evidence against the wrong promotion.

APPEND-ONLY AND IDEMPOTENT. A re-run appends a new row; a repeat of the same
(promotion, check, run id) returns the existing one. The run id includes the
CI attempt number, so a re-run of one step records afresh rather than
colliding with the first attempt.
