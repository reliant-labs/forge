// The `--gate-json` producers: the boundary where a verb's own verdict
// becomes a gate document (control-plane
// docs/design/hosted-deploy-primitives.md §3.3).
//
// WHY THE MAPPING LIVES HERE AND NOT IN EACH VERB. A producing verb knows
// what it checked and how it went; it should not have to know pkg/release's
// gate vocabulary, the closed status set, or the document format. So each verb
// reports its verdict in its own terms and ONE function per boundary maps it.
// internal/cli/lint declares the one-method GateWriter it needs and this
// package installs an implementation — the interface lives at the consumer,
// and the dependency runs from the composer (cli) to the leaf (lint), never
// back.
//
// The practical payoff: lint's three verdict values are three strings in its
// own package, and if the closed set ever grows, the only place that learns
// about it is release.ParseGateStatus and this file.

//     distinction exit 2 draws from exit 1: reporting it as a failure would
//     blame the release for a truncated log.
//   - FAIL → `failed`. Real findings: failing packages, or packages that
//     skipped so much their pass proves nothing.
//   - NOT APPLICABLE → `skipped`. The stream carried no package with tests.
//     NOT a pass: a suite that ran nothing has not vouched for anything, and
//     this is the exact green-while-blind shape the command exists to expose.
//   - PASS → `passed`.
//
// The counts ride along in details, so the evidence says "412 passed, 0
// failed, 3 skipped" rather than just "passed" — a fact a reviewer can act on
