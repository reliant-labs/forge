// Per-file extension-point hints for Tier-1 drift.
//
// When the stomp guard catches a hand-edited Tier-1 file, the worst
// thing the error can do is lead with `forge project disown`: agents take the
// path of least resistance, disown the file, and permanently lose
// regeneration (the failure chain this whole subsystem exists to
// prevent). The right answer is almost always "your customization has
// a designated user-owned home" — these hints name that home, per
// file shape, so the error message teaches the extension point first
// and the disown one-way door last.
//
// ── Why the hint must be TOTAL ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An audit of every disown in the fleet found ZERO that were deliberate,
// permanent ownership choices. Every one was a forge gap wearing an
// ownership hat: a missing extension point (the whole Connect
// interceptor / CORS / extra-route edge has no user-owned surface at
// all), a migration shield, or a gap that has since been closed and left
// the disown behind as dead weight.
//
// The mechanism that produced that outcome is this function returning
// "". A blank hint reads as "forge has no opinion, do what you like",
// and the only remedy left on screen is the one-way door. So the hint
// is TOTAL: every Tier-1 path resolves to exactly one of two answers.
//
//	SEAM EXISTS  → name the user-owned file and the hook. Editing the
//	               generated file is simply the wrong move.
//	NO SEAM      → say so, in those words, and name the seam that is
//	               missing. A file with no extension point is a FORGE
//	               DEFECT, not a project problem; the user's next action
//	               is to report the named gap, not to quietly fork.
//
// The NO-SEAM branch is the feature that replaces `forge project
// disown`. Disown's real payload was always the `--reason` string — the
// design feedback saying "forge could not express this". Naming the gap
// at the moment of friction captures that payload without also
// suppressing regeneration forever.
