// The vitest `resolve.dedupe` reconcile, for projects that predate it.
//
// WHY FORGE TOUCHES A USER-OWNED FILE AT ALL. vitest.config.ts is
// scaffold-once — written at birth and never rewritten, because a test config
// is exactly the kind of thing a project outgrows. But forge moved the
// generated hooks' React Query machinery into @reliantlabs/forge-web-runtime, and
// that move has a consequence no existing project can see coming:
//
// A dev build of forge bridges the runtime with a `file:` specifier, which npm
// materialises as a SYMLINK to the forge checkout. npm cannot hoist a linked
// package's own node_modules away, and a bundler resolves a module's bare
// imports by walking up from that module's own location. So the runtime binds
// React and @tanstack/react-query out of the FORGE CHECKOUT while the app
// binds its own. Two copies of React Query means two React contexts — and
// since every generated `use<Rpc>` now runs inside the runtime's factory, the
// <QueryClientProvider> a test mounts is invisible to the hook beneath it:
//
//	TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')
//
// The project did nothing wrong and has no way to know: it typechecks, it
// builds, and the failure is in a file forge generated, caused by a
// dependency edge forge introduced. Leaving it is not "preserving the user's
// config", it is shipping them a red test suite. So the same reasoning that
// justifies rewriteRenamedFrontendImports applies here — and this pass is
// held to the same limits: it adds ONE key to the existing resolve block,
// changes nothing else, and does nothing at all when the key is present.
//
// A registry (non-dev) install hoists one copy and never had the problem, so
// this line is inert there. It is written unconditionally anyway: the same
// project is bridged and unbridged at different times depending on who built
// the forge binary, and a config that only works under one of them is worse
// than one that works under both.

// dedupeKeyRe finds an existing `dedupe:` entry inside a resolve block — the
// signal that this config already handles the hazard (either from a current
// scaffold or from a previous run of this pass).
var dedupeKeyRe = regexp.MustCompile(`(?m)^\s*dedupe\s*:`)

// resolveOpenRe matches the opening of vitest's `resolve: {` block, which is
// where the dedupe key is inserted. Anchored on the key so it cannot match
// `path.resolve(` or a `resolve` import.
var resolveOpenRe = regexp.MustCompile(`(?m)^(\s*)resolve\s*:\s*\{`)

// dedupedPackages are the packages that must resolve to exactly one copy.
//
// Spelled out rather than read from the runtime's package.json (as the
// scaffolded config does) because this pass EDITS an existing file: a literal
// list is a one-line insertion that a user can read and delete, while
// injecting the file-reading preamble would mean restructuring imports in a
// config forge does not own. The scaffolded form stays derived; this repair
// stays minimal.
// DERIVED, not hand-written. This was a literal that had already drifted from
// the runtime's real peerDependencies by nine packages (including
// @opentelemetry/api). See internal/webruntimepeers for the source of truth.
