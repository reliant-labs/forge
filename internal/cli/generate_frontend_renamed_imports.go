// The frontend Tier-1 `_gen` rename, from the importer's side.
//
// Renaming a generated Go file is invisible to the rest of the package: the
// package is the unit, and nothing names the file. In TypeScript the FILENAME
// IS THE MODULE SPECIFIER, so the same rename breaks every import of it — and
// the importers here are the ones forge does not own:
//
//	src/lib/connect.ts     — scaffold-once; requires "@/lib/mock-transport"
//	src/app/providers.tsx  — scaffold-once; imports "@/lib/otel"
//	src/mocks/scenarios/*  — the user's own scenarios import "../scenario-types"
//	src/hooks/*.test.tsx   — scaffold-once; imports "./<svc>-service-hooks"
//	src/app/**/page.tsx    — scaffold-once; imports "@/hooks/<svc>-service-hooks"
//
// Retiring the old generated FILE without repointing these would leave a
// project that does not compile: the module the import names is simply gone.
// So the retirement sweep (RetireRenamedGenerated) handles forge's own files
// and this handles the references to them.
//
// WHAT IT WILL AND WILL NOT TOUCH. It rewrites exactly one thing: the
// specifier STRING of an import that names a module forge just renamed. It
// does not reformat, does not touch imports of anything else, and does not
// look at a file that does not contain one of these specifiers. A user who
// rewrote their connect.ts entirely still gets their `require()` repointed,
// because the alternative — leaving it dangling — is not a preservation of
// their work, it is a broken build.
//
// It is idempotent by construction: after the rewrite no old specifier
// remains, so a second run finds nothing and writes nothing. That is what
// keeps `forge generate` twice-in-a-row clean.

// renamedFrontendModule is one old→new module specifier pair.

// rewriteRenamedImportsInFile rewrites the specifier strings in one file.

// The match is on the QUOTED specifier (`"@/lib/otel"`, `'@/lib/otel'`), not
// on the bare path, which is what keeps it from corrupting a longer specifier
// that merely starts with the same characters: `"@/lib/otel"` must be
// rewritten while `"@/lib/otel-custom"` — a module the user wrote — must not.
// The closing quote in the pattern is the whole guard.
//
// A file that carries a forge:hash marker is RE-CERTIFIED before it is
// written, because this pass edits forge's own Tier-1 output as well as the
// user's files. The importers listed at the top of this file are the
// user-owned ones, but Tier-1 renders import renamed modules too
// (mock-transport_gen.ts names the scenarios barrel; the scenarios barrel
// names scenario-types), and an emitter does not always rewrite them first:
// a pristine render of an OLDER vintage is deliberately left alone
// (checksums.AutoHeal is off by default), and a narrowed `--force` scope
// skips everything the drift guard did not name. In those windows this pass
// is the only writer. Changing the bytes while leaving the old hash in place
// makes the file claim a digest it no longer has, so the NEXT run's Tier-1
// stomp guard reports forge's own output as hand-edited and aborts — the
// state a project upgrading across the `_gen` rename got stuck in, which
// `--force` could not clear because each run re-created it.
//
// Only an already-marked file is stamped. An unmarked file is the user's,
// and inventing a marker there would claim forge authorship of a
// scaffold-once file and hand it to the stomp guard to police.

//     and silently bless the edit. Their file is repointed (a dangling import
//     is not a preservation of anyone's work) but left uncertified, so the
//     guard still sees it.
//   - NO MARKER → not forge's file at all. Left alone.
