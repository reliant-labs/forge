// TestE2EGenerateFailsOnUnrenderableDeployKCL is the end-to-end half of the
// #322 incident: a deploy tree that does not compile must make `forge generate`
// exit NON-ZERO.
//
// It used to exit 0. The KCL load error was downgraded to a warning, so a
// project whose env declared a field the closed schema had removed got a clean
// generate and discovered the break later, at `forge env render` — an error
// with no connection to the command that had already reported success. The
// silently-no-opping registry migration put projects into exactly that state.
//
// The fault is injected the way the incident produced it: a field the schema
// does not accept, added to a real scaffolded env. The assertion is on the exit
// code and on the error naming the env, because a non-zero exit that does not
// say WHICH env or WHAT kcl said has moved the discovery rather than prevented
// it.
