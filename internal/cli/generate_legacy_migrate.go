// One-time pipeline migration off the legacy .forge/checksums.json
// global manifest onto self-certifying files (forge:hash markers).
//
// The conversion rules live in internal/checksums/migrate.go. This file
// owns the pipeline integration:
//
//   - stepMigrateLegacyManifest runs between state load and the Tier-1
//     stomp guard. Pristine legacy entries get stamped; disowned ones
//     convert to .forge/disowned.json; entries whose bytes match
//     NOTHING the manifest recorded (kalshi fr-9a54388f0b: a manifest
//     committed from a different work lane) are quarantined on
//     ctx.LegacyUnverified with their writes side-render redirected.
//   - finishLegacyMigration runs after the step loop: each quarantined
//     path whose fresh side render matches the on-disk bytes is proven
//     pristine and stamped; everything else is stamped with the
//     unverified-legacy sentinel and reported through the standard
//     drift error (guard semantics: --force regenerates exactly the
//     named files, `forge disown` keeps them).
//
// The legacy manifest is deleted by the migration itself — durable even
// when the run later aborts. The unverified sentinel keeps the guard
// honest across runs until the user resolves each file.
