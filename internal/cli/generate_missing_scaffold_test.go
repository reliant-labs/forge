//
// The assertions are about the two facts the measured run needed and did
// not get: WHICH file, and WHAT action restores it. They deliberately do
// not pin the full prose (that would make every wording improvement a test
// edit); they pin that the file and the remedy are present, because a
// notice missing either one costs the same hour the original defect did.
