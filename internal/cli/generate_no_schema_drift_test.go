// The proto-vs-migration "schema drift" check is GONE, and this pins its
// absence so it is not reintroduced by someone reading the old comments.
//
// It compared proto message fields against migration columns BY NAME. That
// pairing was coherent only while proto entity annotations declared the
// schema. Migrations are now the only schema truth and proto is the wire
// shape, so the two are not required to agree, and the check reported every
// legitimate divergence as a defect:
//
//   - users.onboarding_completed is DERIVED — the response message computes
//     it, no column backs it, and none should;
//   - plans.price_cents is stored inside a JSONB column on purpose;
//   - every API response message with no table at all.
//
// On a clean control-plane tree (exit 0, zero files changed) it printed 19
// suggested ALTER statements, none of which may be applied. A suggestion
// that must be ignored every time trains the reader to ignore the whole
// notice block, which is the cost this removal is paying back.
//
// The delete is total: internal/codegen/schemadrift, the always-on notice in
// stepPostGenValidate, and `forge db check` (schemadrift was its only
// engine). There is deliberately no opt-in marker to bring it back — an
// opt-in check with no correct signal is still no correct signal.
