// Auto-retire obsolete disowns.
//
// `forge disown` is a last-resort one-way escape hatch: it tells forge
// "stop regenerating this Tier-1 file, the bytes are mine now". Needing
// it routinely means a missing extension point. A disown that has become
// OBSOLETE — forge no longer Tier-1-owns that path — is dead weight: it
// protects against an overwrite that can no longer happen, and it
// misleads users into thinking disown is normal.
//
// The canonical case: a project disowned a frontend page.tsx under an
// OLD forge that regenerated page.tsx as Tier-1. The current forge makes
// page.tsx Tier-2 (scaffold-once: written if absent, NEVER overwritten).
// The disown is now meaningless — forge would never overwrite a Tier-2
// file anyway — yet it lingered across version migrations and had to be
// hand-dropped.
//
// THE FIX: during `forge generate`, after every Tier-1 emitter has run,
// detect disowns whose path is NO LONGER a current Tier-1 emit target
// and auto-retire them (remove from .forge/disowned.json) with a loud
// per-path notice. A disown is:
//
//   - STILL VALID when its path IS a current Tier-1 emit target — forge
//     WOULD regenerate it but for the disown. The target set
//     (checksums.Tier1TargetSet) records every path a Tier-1 writer
//     touched this run, BEFORE the disown-skip, so a disowned-but-live
//     Tier-1 path is still in the set. Leave it alone.
//   - OBSOLETE when its path is NOT a current Tier-1 emit target — it
//     became a Tier-2 scaffold-once file, or forge stopped emitting it.
//     Retire it.
//
// Conservatism: a disowned path can be absent from the target set for a
// reason unrelated to tiering — the emitter that WOULD own it was gated
// OFF this run (e.g. a frontend file under features.frontend=false). In
// that case absence is uninformative and we must NOT retire. The
// `targetable` predicate below gates retirement on "an emitter that
// could own this path as Tier-1 actually ran this run", so a gated-off
// subsystem never sheds its legitimate disowns.
