// Root-cause attribution for the failed-generate report.
//
// FRICTION (third dogfood run): a generate run aborted on a typecheck
// error in a generated test helper (`invalid composite literal type
// tagging.Role`). The rollback rewound 71 files — correctly — but that
// restored an OLDER handlers_crud_ops_gen.go, and the errors the user was
// then shown were:
//
//	internal/handlers/documents/scoping.go:66:10: s.crudGetDocumentOp undefined
//
// four times, against a hand-written file that compiles standalone. The
// user spent four turns debugging a correct file. The real fault was two
// files away and had already been detected — forge simply did not say
// which error was the one that mattered.
//
// The rollback itself is right and stays. Two things about how it REPORTS
// are not:
//
//  1. Downstream errors produced AFTER a rollback restored stale files
//     were presented as equals to the root cause. An error citing a file
//     forge never wrote this run is an artifact of the revert, and the
//     user must never be sent to debug it.
//
//  2. The build verdict on the restored tree was conflated with the
//     FIDELITY of the revert. Both claims were collapsed into one
//     sentence, so a non-compiling tree suppressed "back to its pre-run
//     state" — as though the rollback had failed to restore it.
//
// (2) was over-corrected and is now stated as two independent facts.
// The revert IS byte-faithful: it rewrites every journaled path from the
// bytes captured before the run, so "back to its pre-run state" is true
// whenever the journal restored cleanly, whatever the tree then does
// under a compiler. Whether that tree BUILDS is a separate question, and
// a "no" is usually a statement about where the user already was, not
// about the rollback.
//
// That distinction is load-bearing, because a pre-run tree that does not
// compile is a supported, deliberate state. `forge scaffold worker x
// --no-generate` exists to stage a component without running the
// pipeline — it writes cmd/<bin>/cmd/workers/x.go referencing an accessor
// that only a later generate emits. Every project mid-stage is in exactly
// this state, and telling those users the restored tree "does NOT
// compile" as if the revert had stranded them sends them to debug a
// rollback that did its job perfectly. Forge now reports the revert's
// fidelity unconditionally, and the compile verdict beside it, attributed
// to the pre-run tree where it belongs.

// rollbackRootCauseMarker labels the error that actually aborted the run.
// It is the one error on screen the user should act on, and it is printed
// under this marker whether or not anything else follows.

// Why verify rather than roll back more cleverly: a fully-consistent
// rollback would have to revert files this run did NOT write (compose.go
// was kept from an EARLIER successful run, so it is outside the journal by
// construction), which means either snapshotting the whole working tree —
// explicitly out of scope for the journal, and guaranteed to manufacture
// spurious diffs from `go mod tidy` and friends — or reverting files the
// user may have hand-edited. Both are worse than the honest report. So
// forge keeps the bounded revert and stops CLAIMING more than it verified.
//
// A build failure here is not an error condition for the pipeline: the run
// has already failed, and this only decides which message is truthful.
