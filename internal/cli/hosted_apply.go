// Reading the control plane's apply records. THERE IS NO WRITE HALF.
//
// WHAT WENT, AND WHY. This file used to own BeginApply, FinishApply,
// FinishApplyWithObserved and ListApplies — the bracket around a forge-driven
// apply, with a compare-and-set on the way in and a reported outcome on the
// way out. All four are gone because NOTHING EVER CALLED THEM. Forge's own
// cluster apply (cluster.Apply, through the deploy dispatch) reports its
// outcome by succeeding or failing, and no verb in this package brackets it
// with a durable record. The four RPCs, the guard encoder and the observed-
// objects variant were a client for a protocol with no caller on either side.
//
// That is the whole justification: dead code, removed. It is deliberately NOT
// the claim that forge does not apply — it does, and its direct cluster apply
// is the supported path for every env today.
//
// What remains is the DECODE, which has a real consumer: hosted_live.go reads
// these records through GetLiveView. They are OBSERVATIONS the control plane's
// own observer wrote — append-only, never required for correctness — and
// reading what another system reports was never the half that lacked a caller.
//
// The reported-by label survives in the wire shape and is still set by the
// SERVER rather than sent, because the record remains a claim by whoever made
// it and a reader has to see whose. If a verb ever does want to report an
// apply of its own, the request shape should be designed for that verb rather
// than restored from here.
