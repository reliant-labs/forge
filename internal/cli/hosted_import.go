// ImportLedger (doc §6.3, §11): the one-time migration of a project's git
// file ledger into its control plane, in ONE transaction.
//
// EVERY ITEM IS A TYPED MESSAGE, not a Struct. The import is the one path
// that writes HISTORY — rows whose created_at predates the import, into
// append-only tables protected by a reject-update trigger — so there is no
// second chance to fix a field that was mis-spelled on the way in. A typed
// message makes a missing field a compile-time or decode-time failure on the
// server; a Struct would make it a silently absent column in an immutable row.
//
// IDEMPOTENT ON `imported_from`. Each item carries the git path or id it came
// from, so a re-run inserts nothing new. That is what makes the import safe to
// retry after a partial failure, and it is why every list below carries the
// field rather than the request carrying one value for all of them: two runs
// over overlapping ranges must dedupe per RECORD.
//
// WHAT IT REFUSES, and why forge does not pre-check it: any env of kind
// persistent or preview (whose history was always hosted), and any env that
// already holds a non-imported promotion (where ordering would be ambiguous).
// Both are judged inside the transaction, against rows that could change under
// a client-side read.
//
// `promoted_by_actor` on an imported promotion is a HISTORICAL NAME — the
// string the old ledger recorded — and is provenance only. It is never read as
// identity: identity comes from the credential, and the credential that
// performed a 2025 promote is not the one running the import (O-11).
