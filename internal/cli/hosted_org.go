// The organization an env's hosted artifacts belong to is the organization the
// control-plane CREDENTIAL acts for. forge asks the control plane
// (cloud.ResolveOrganization) rather than reading a declaration: a declared
// copy could only agree with the token or be wrong, and the registry's realm
// scopes a push to the token's own org either way.
//
// Two ways to read it, because the surfaces differ:
//
//   - strict (organization, requireOrg): the authenticated entry points — a
//     build that pushes, a deploy, a release cut, `forge registry login`. They
//     already need the credential, so a failure to resolve the org is a
//     failure, said once, at the top, naming what to do.
//   - best-effort (declaredPushBase): render, plan, diff and lint. These run
//     with no credential on a fresh checkout and must not fail for want of one;
//     they compose a base when the org is knowable and say nothing when not.
//
// The answer — success OR failure — is cached for the process, so a command that
// reads it at several depths makes one call. Failure is cached on purpose: an
// offline render with a stored credential would otherwise wait out a network
// timeout at every depth it composes a base.
