// Resolving an env's platform push base.
//
// There is one rule — `<registry_host>/<org>/<project>` — and it lives in
// internal/hostedimage.PushBase. The registry host and the project come from
// the declaration; the org comes from the CREDENTIAL (hosted_org.go). What
// lives here is the KCLEntities-shaped adapter over it, plus the errors a
// caller needs when a base cannot be composed.
//
// EVERY CONSUMER READS THIS, AND NOTHING ELSE. The build, the deploy, the
// release-coverage gate, `forge env render` and `forge lint` all resolve a
// hosted address through this one function, so the address a build pushes to is
// the address a deploy pins and the address a render judges.
