// machineRecordStore.
//
// `bundleRecorder` is satisfied in full: F4 left it unsatisfied because the
// seam as declared could not carry the bundle's own BYTES, and the server
// records what it VERIFIES rather than what a client describes. The seam is
// now wide enough — see binding_store.go.
//
// There is no apply recorder, here or anywhere, because no caller ever wanted
// one — see binding_store.go on the absent seam. The convergence records that
// DO exist are written by the control plane's own observer and READ through
// GetLiveView.
