// hosted deploy ships, and `forge env deploy` can pin them from the binding.
//
// WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM THE BUILD-STATE HARVEST. A SimpleBackend names an
// image forge usually did not build (CI pushed it, or it is a third-party
// image), so there is no .forge/state record to project. The declaration is
// the source of truth for WHICH image; the registry is the source of truth for
// WHICH BYTES:
//
//   - a digest-pinned image (`repo@sha256:…`) is recorded as declared;
//   - a tag-pinned image is resolved to its digest NOW, at cut time. That is
//     the one moment the tag is allowed to mean something: once recorded, the
//     release pins the bytes and a later re-push of the tag changes nothing.
//
// An artifact the build-state harvest already recorded (forge built and
// pushed it) wins: it is the digest of the bytes this very pipeline produced.
// Artifacts are keyed by hostedArtifactKey, the same rule the hosted provider
// pins by, so the cut and the deploy cannot disagree.
