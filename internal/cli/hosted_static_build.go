// `<push>/static.v1/<frontend>` — where `<push>` is the org's image push base,
// the one registry subtree the control plane admits this org's artifacts from.
//
// The digest is recorded as ordinary build state under the frontend's name,
// with the registry set to `<push>/static.v1`, so the existing harvest turns
// it into a shared OCI release artifact whose URI + name is the real
// repository (and `forge release verify` can fetch its manifest).
//
// It runs only with --push: a site release that is not registry-addressable
// cannot be pinned, promoted or pulled by the platform.
//
// # The artifact carries NO runtime config
//
// A hosted release is promoted between environments by digest. A config.js
// baked in here would carry the BUILD env's values into every env the
// release is promoted to — staging's API origin, served to production users.
// So no document is written into the tree (and the dev copy `forge generate`
// keeps in the frontend's public/ is stripped from it). The environment's
// document is spec instead: the StaticSite's runtimeConfig, which the
// control plane resolves and writes after each sync (hostedStaticSpec).
