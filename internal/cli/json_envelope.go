// The ONE --json envelope every hosted deploy verb carries.
//
// `deploy --json` established the pattern and the reason for it: ok and
// exit_code are not a second opinion about what happened, they are computed
// from the SAME error the text path returns. Two independent switches
// someone has to keep in agreement is exactly the bug this avoids — a
// pipeline that reads ok:true from a document whose process exited 1 has no
// way to discover which half is lying.
//
// So a verb does not assemble these three fields itself. It embeds
// jsonEnvelope in its own document and calls stamp once, with the error it
// is about to return.

// jsonEnvelope is the common head of every hosted --json document. Embed it;
// the verb's own fields follow.
type jsonEnvelope struct {
	// OK is true exactly when the process will exit 0.
	OK bool `json:"ok"`
	// ExitCode is exactly the code the process will exit with — one of the
	// exit* constants, resolved the same way main() resolves it.
	ExitCode int `json:"exit_code"`
	// Error is the failure message when OK is false, and absent when the
	// verb succeeded. Omitted rather than empty so a consumer can test for
	// the key.
	Error string `json:"error,omitempty"`
}

// stamp fills the envelope from the error the verb is returning. err == nil
// is success; anything else carries its message and its resolved code.
//
// Takes the error rather than a code so the two cannot diverge: there is no
// way to call this and report a code the error does not produce.

// exitCodeForError is the process status an error produces — the SAME
// resolution main() performs, so a reported code is the one the shell sees
// rather than a guess that happens to agree most of the time.
//
// An error carrying no explicit code is exitWrong, not exitUndetermined: an
// unclassified failure is a failure we DID observe. Defaulting the other way
// would let an ordinary bug read as "could not look", which is the one
// answer CI treats as retryable.

// stdout would produce a stream no `jq` invocation can read, and the failure
