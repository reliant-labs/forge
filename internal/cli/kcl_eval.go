//
// `forge kcl eval <file> [-S <path>]…` — evaluate ONE KCL file of this
// project and print a field out of it.
//
// # Why this command exists
//
// forge #277 made the `forge` KCL module come from the forge binary, so that
// the binary rendering a project IS the module version it renders against.
// A consequence, and an intended one, is that `kcl run` on a project file
// that says `import forge` cannot work: there is no dependency to fetch and
// no copy on disk. Nothing but forge evaluates a forge project's KCL.
//
// That left a real gap. A project keeps plain declarative constants in
// library files — control-plane's deploy/kcl/lib/kata_pool.k declares the GKE
// node-pool inputs its build scripts need, lib/daemon_placement.k declares
// which cluster each env's daemon pods land in — and those files are read by
// scripts and tests, never deployed. `forge env render` evaluates an
// ENVIRONMENT into Kubernetes objects, which is not that. So there was no
// forge command for "evaluate this file, give me this field".
//
// What filled the gap went around forge, which is the thing that must not
// happen. control-plane grew scripts/lib/kcl-forge-module.sh: make forge
// materialize its module into FORGE_KCL_MODULE_CACHE, dig the directory out
// of the cache, then run `kcl run <file> -S <field> -E forge=<dir>` — forge's
// own render setup, reconstructed from outside, pinned to the cache layout
// and the module name, and needing `kcl` on PATH that forge itself has not
// needed since it embedded the runtime. The same reconstruction sat in a Go
// test (internal/operators/shared/daemon_placement_test.go). Every one of
// those is a forge defect that got worked around instead of reported, and the
// fix is a forge command, not a better script.
//
// # Why `forge kcl eval` and not `forge env render --file`
//
// Because it is not a render of an environment, and every flag `env render`
// has says so. That command resolves an image tag from build state, applies
// digests, templates declared helm charts, and attributes each object to the
// cluster `forge env deploy` would apply it to — `--tag`, `--cluster`,
// `--kind`, `--target`, `--no-digest`, `--no-charts` are all meaningless for
// a library file that declares seven strings. Hanging `--file` off it would
// put the whole env surface in front of callers who want one constant, and
// would have to answer what `--cluster` means for a file with no workloads.
//
// A `kcl` group also says the true thing about scope: the unit is a KCL file,
// and the group is where a future `forge kcl fmt` or `forge kcl options`
// belongs. `env render` remains the way to evaluate an environment.
//
// # Read-only
//
// The evaluation claims nothing. The read-only halves of the render context
// are armed (see armReadOnlyKCLContext): fp.allocate_port resolves keys to
// blocks they already hold, fp.resolve_port reads its store without writing
// it, and fp.write_file is disarmed. A read-only command never claims a port
// block (#272). KCL's own `file.write` is not forge's to suppress — see
// `env render`'s note on the same subject — so a file that generates a file
// on evaluation still does, and that is reported on stderr.

		Use:   "eval <file> [-S <path>]...",

This is THE way a script or a test reads a value from project KCL. A plain
` + "`kcl run`" + ` cannot do it: since the forge KCL module is supplied by the forge
binary, ` + "`import forge`" + ` resolves only inside a forge evaluation. Nothing needs
` + "`kcl`" + ` on PATH, and nothing needs to know where forge keeps its module.

The file is evaluated with its OWN kcl.mod package root as the working
directory, so a relative import (` + "`import lib.foo`" + `) resolves exactly as it does
for a shell script that cd'd there first. It does not matter which directory
you run this from: the answer is the same from the project root and from a
subdirectory.

-S takes a dotted path, kcl-style. A numeric segment indexes a list
(` + "`pools.0.name`" + `). Repeat -S to get an object keyed by selector. Unlike
` + "`kcl run -S`" + `, a selected LIST comes back as one list rather than as one YAML
document per element, and a path that does not exist is an ERROR naming what
the document does have — not an empty result that a caller reads as a value.

--format raw prints a scalar's own text: no quotes, no trailing newline. It is
what makes ` + "`$(...)`" + ` capture the value exactly, replacing the
` + "`| tr -d \"\\n'\\\"\"`" + ` pipelines that a YAML scalar's conditional quoting forces
(and that silently corrupt a value legitimately containing a quote). It
refuses a list or an object rather than printing JSON a caller would
interpolate without noticing.

-D binds a top-level ` + "`option()`" + `, as it does for any KCL evaluation.

The evaluation is READ-ONLY as far as forge is concerned: no port block is
claimed, no port store is written, no cluster is contacted, and no image is
built. It is not guaranteed PURE, for the same reason ` + "`env render`" + ` is not:
KCL evaluates ` + "`file.write`" + ` itself, so a file that generates a file writes it.

To evaluate an ENVIRONMENT into its Kubernetes objects, use
` + "`" + Name() + " env render <env>`" + ` instead.

Examples:
  ` + Name() + ` kcl eval deploy/kcl/lib/kata_pool.k -S sbd.image_family --format raw
  ` + Name() + ` kcl eval deploy/kcl/lib/kata_pool.k -S sbd.disk_size_gb --format raw
  ` + Name() + ` kcl eval deploy/kcl/lib/daemon_placement.k -S daemon_placement | jq -r '.prod.context'
  ` + Name() + ` kcl eval deploy/kcl/lib/platform_local.k -S cloudnative_pg.name -S cloudnative_pg.namespace
  ` + Name() + ` kcl eval deploy/kcl/lib/kata_pool.k                       # the whole document`,
