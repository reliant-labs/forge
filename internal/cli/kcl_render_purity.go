// File: internal/cli/kcl_render_purity.go
//
// `forge generate` must be a pure function of COMMITTED inputs. This guard
// enforces that across the one seam where it silently was not: KCL evaluation.
//
// A KCL render is not obliged to be side-effect-free. KCL's stdlib has
// file.write, and a project can legitimately materialize config as a side
// effect of a render — control-plane generates its shared dev NATS config that
// way, one account per active dev stack, and `forge env up dev` depends on it.
//
// The problem is which command runs the render. `forge generate` renders KCL
// only to READ things (dev gateway listeners for deploy/k3d-ports.yaml, the
// frontend config probe, the CI frontend set). Those are queries. But a query
// still evaluates the whole module, so every file.write in it fires too — and
// generate has no idea it happened, because those writes bypass forge's own
// write chokepoint and therefore appear in no manifest, no checksum, and no
// rollback journal.
//
// Incident (control-plane, cutting v0.1.9). The dev KCL derives its NATS
// accounts from `.forge/blocks.json` — the machine-local, GITIGNORED
// port-block registry — and writes them to `deploy/nats/nats.conf`, which is
// TRACKED. On a machine where someone had once run `forge env up prod`, the
// registry held an extra key, so a plain `forge generate` on a clean checkout
// emitted an extra NATS account into version control:
//
//	CP_prod_: {
//	  jetstream: enabled
//	  users: [ { user: "control-plane-prod-", password: "control-plane-dev-nats-prod-" } ]
//	}
//
// Two developers on the same commit produced different bytes, and CI's Verify
// Generated Code job failed for whoever's local state differed. The tell was
// that `git status` was dirty after `forge generate` on a checkout nobody had
// edited — with a file forge could not explain, because forge had not written
// it.
//
// ── What this guard does ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It brackets each generate-path render with git and treats any tracked file
// that goes from clean to dirty ACROSS the render as a purity violation: forge
// writes nothing through its own chokepoint while KCL is evaluating, so such a
// file can only have come from a file.write in the module.
//
// It then restores that file and reports the defect. Restoring is safe by
// construction and is the point rather than a courtesy: the file is only
// touched when it was verifiably identical to HEAD immediately before the
// render, so putting HEAD's bytes back cannot discard anyone's work — this
// checkout is routinely shared with other agents — and it leaves `forge
// generate` unable to dirty a clean tree.
//
// The render's VALUE is kept. The write is what gets undone, not the query
// that needed the render, so k3d-ports.yaml and the frontend config still
// generate from the same evaluation.
//
// Scope is deliberately generate-only. `forge env up` / `forge env deploy` arm
// the dev-stack allocator and WANT these writes — materializing per-stack
// config is their job. Only generate claims reproducibility, so only generate
// enforces it.
