// `forge ledger` — the verbs that act on a ledger as a whole, independent of
// any one environment.
//
// `forge release` is the noun for a release LEDGER's contents (verify a
// version, locate one) and `forge env deploy` advances one env's binding.
// What lives here is different in kind: moving a whole ledger from one store
// to another. It is not `forge env import` because an import is not scoped to
// an environment — it carries every env's history plus the releases those
// promotions reference, and importing one env's promotions without the
// releases they name would record bindings pointing at nothing.
//
// IMPORT IS THE ONE WAY FORWARD FROM THE RETIRED IN-CHECKOUT LEDGER. forge no
// longer reads .forge/promotions or .forge/releases, and selection REFUSES
// (ledger_unimported.go) while a checkout still holds records the selected
// store lacks — because the alternative is a versionless deploy concluding
// "never promoted" and shipping mutable tags instead of the digests those
// promotions froze. This command is what makes that refusal go quiet, and it
// goes quiet by construction: the refusal matches promotions by id, the
// import preserves ids, so once the records are in the store the comparison
// finds nothing missing. No flag, no state, nothing to remember.

TWO SOURCES:

  --from-git [--rev <ref>]        the retired in-checkout ledger
                                 (.forge/releases/*.json and
                                 .forge/promotions/<env>.jsonl) as COMMITTED at
                                 a rev. Default rev: ` + defaultImportRev + `.
  --from-file-ledger <dir>       a machine ledger directory, for an env whose
                                 KCL newly declares a control plane.

IT READS A REV, NEVER THE WORKING TREE. The retired ledger was committed, so
the repository is the authority. A ` + "`.forge/promotions`" + ` deleted but not
committed still has its history, and a half-written local edit is not history
at all.

HISTORY IS NEVER RE-JUDGED. Every record is admitted exactly as written,
including the uncomfortable parts — a release cut from a dirty tree is imported
saying so. Promotion ids and timestamps are preserved verbatim: the id is how a
re-run recognises what it already recorded, and the timestamp is the order an
environment actually moved in.

IDEMPOTENT. Running ` + "`--apply`" + ` twice records once. A run interrupted half-way
is re-run, not repaired.

IT REFUSES AN ENVIRONMENT THAT ALREADY HOLDS PROMOTIONS OF ITS OWN. An
append-only log's current binding is its last line, so interleaving imported
history with promotions made since would leave the environment reading whatever
sorted last. The remedy is to import first.

Examples:
