// `forge ledger export --dir D` — write the selected ledger out in
// file-ledger format.
//
// IT EXISTS ONLY TO VERIFY AN IMPORT (owner decision O-1, doc §7.2, §11.1
// step 7). The sequence it serves is exactly one: import a git ledger, export
// it to a throwaway directory, and diff that against the `.forge/{releases,
// promotions}` files it came from. If the two agree, the import did not lose
// or reorder anything — which is the only way to know that before the source
// files are deleted (§11.1 step 9).
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT, stated here because the file's mere existence invites the
// wrong reading:
//
//   - It is NOT a backup, and must not be documented, scheduled or scaffolded
//     as one. A second copy of deploy history that nobody writes to goes stale
//     the moment the next promotion lands, and a stale ledger that LOOKS
//     authoritative is worse than none — it is the exact failure the machine
//     ledger was moved out of the checkout to end.
//   - There is NO `--git-ref` and no git export. O-1 removed the git side in
//     both directions: from this point a project's deploy history lives in the
//     hosted ledger or the machine ledger, and in no commit.
//   - It is not a migration path BETWEEN stores. That is `ledger import
//     --from-file-ledger`, which reads the same layout and goes through the
//     import's rules rather than writing files past them.
//
// Hence `--dir` is required with no default: there is no blessed location,
// because a blessed location is a thing people start to rely on.
//
// BYTE-EQUAL MODULO DOCUMENTED NORMALIZATIONS. The export writes the store's
// own canonical JSON, which is what makes the round trip meaningful rather
// than a re-rendering: see exportNormalizations for the four differences
// against a retired git ledger, each of which is a fact about the SOURCE
// format rather than a lossy step in the import.

THIS IS A VERIFICATION AID, NOT A BACKUP. It exists for one sequence:

  ` + Name() + ` ledger import --from-git --rev origin/main --apply
  ` + Name() + ` ledger export --dir /tmp/verify
  diff -r /tmp/verify/promotions .forge/promotions

If those agree, the import lost nothing — which is what you need to know
before the committed ledger is deleted from the repository.

It is NOT a way to keep a second copy of deploy history. A copy nothing writes
to is stale as soon as the next promotion lands, and a stale ledger that looks
authoritative is the failure the ledger was moved out of the checkout to end.
There is no git export in either direction, and no default directory — a
default is a thing people start to rely on.

The output is the ledger's own canonical JSON, so a diff is meaningful rather
than a re-rendering. Four differences against a retired git ledger are
expected and are printed with every run.

  ` + Name() + ` ledger export --dir /tmp/verify
  ` + Name() + ` ledger export --dir /tmp/verify --env prod   # the ledger prod selected`,
