// The checkout still holds a ledger the selected one has never imported.
//
// WHY THIS REFUSES RATHER THAN FALLING BACK. forge used to keep promotions in
// .forge/promotions/<env>.jsonl and releases in .forge/releases/*.json,
// INSIDE the checkout. Those files are no longer read: the ledger is either
// the control plane (an env that declares forge.ControlPlane) or the
// machine-scoped store under $FORGE_LEDGER_HOME. control-plane's own
// checkout holds 10 promotions and 39 releases in the retired location.
//
// If a command simply read the new, empty ledger, `forge env deploy prod`
// would find NO promotion for prod, conclude "never promoted", and fall back
// to deploying mutable tags instead of the digests those promotions froze.
// That is the single failure this entire design exists to prevent, and it
// would happen silently, on the most important env, at the moment of a
// release. So a checkout ledger the selected store has not imported is a
// hard refusal naming the remedy — the same fail-loud shape as the retired
// errLegacyLedger it replaces.
//
// IT APPLIES TO BOTH BACKENDS. The doc states the refusal for an env whose
// ledger moved to a control plane (§11.3) and for a non-empty machine ledger
// (§12.4), but the hazard is identical whenever the SELECTED ledger lacks
// records the checkout holds — and control-plane's prod, which declares no
// control plane, lands on the machine ledger. A rule that fired only for
// hosted envs would miss exactly the case that motivated it.
//
// IT GOES QUIET BY CONSTRUCTION. Once `forge ledger import` has recorded
// those promotions, the selected ledger contains them, the comparison finds
// nothing missing, and the refusal stops — with no flag to remember and no
// state beyond the ledger itself.
