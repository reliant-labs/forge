// `forge ledger where <env>` — which backend holds this env's ledger, and
// WHY.
//
// The "why" is the point, and it is why this is a command rather than a line
// in `env status`. Ledger selection is declarative and invisible: an env
// whose KCL declares `forge.ControlPlane` records there, every other env
// records in this machine's store, and nothing in a normal command's output
// says which happened. So the two questions a user actually has when a
// promotion is "missing" — where did it go, and what decided that — have no
// answer anywhere.
//
// It answers them by rendering the env and reporting the DECLARATION it
// found, not by guessing from what exists. A ledger that happens to hold
// records is not evidence it is the selected one: a project that moved an
// env to a control plane still has the old machine-ledger files sitting
// there, and "where are the records" and "where do records GO" are different
// questions with, briefly, different answers.

Selection is DECLARATIVE and has no flag: an environment whose KCL declares
` + "`forge.ControlPlane`" + ` records on that control plane — whatever its kind,
including local — and every other environment records in this machine's
ledger under $FORGE_LEDGER_HOME (default ~/.forge/ledger), keyed by project so
that every worktree of a project shares one history.

This renders the environment and reports the declaration it FOUND. It does not
infer the answer from which store happens to hold records: a project that has
moved an environment to a control plane still has its old machine-ledger files
on disk, and "where are the records" is a different question from "where do
records go".
