// Package cli — `forge project libraries`: where forge/pkg actually is on
// THIS machine, and what each subpackage is for.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A dogfood run caught three independent agents running a
// full-disk `find / -path "*forge/pkg/svcerr*"` in the same session, hunting
// for library source. Every one of them already knew the package name; what
// they could not answer was "where is it, and what else is in there". The
// existing answer — a `forge-libraries` skill — was loaded by nobody, and
// its hand-written table had drifted anyway: it listed a `pkg/dialects` that
// does not exist and omitted nine packages that do. A stale index nobody
// opens is not a routing mechanism.
//
// Everything here is ENUMERATED, never transcribed:
//
//   - the DIRECTORY comes from `go list -m`, so it is the go toolchain's own
//     answer for the pkg version THIS project resolves — a go.work replace
//     in a dev tree, the module cache in a release build, without this code
//     knowing which.
//   - the PACKAGE SET is the subdirectories of that directory.
//   - each PURPOSE is the package's own doc comment, read from that source.
//
// So the output cannot drift from the packages, and it describes the
// version the project actually compiles against rather than whatever the
// forge binary was built beside.

		Use:   "libraries [package...]",

		Long: `Print forge's public runtime libraries, and the full API of any you name.

With NO arguments this is an index: forge ships TWO runtime libraries and it
prints both — forge/pkg for Go and @reliant-labs/web-runtime for the frontend
— one line per package, from each package's own doc comment.

NAME A PACKAGE and it stops being an index and answers the question:

  forge project libraries crud             every signature crud exports
  forge project libraries crud orm svcerr  three packages, one call
  forge project libraries orm.Context      one type, with its methods
  forge project libraries all              everything (large — prefer a list)

That prints every func with its parameters, every struct with its fields,
every interface and type with its methods, parsed out of the source this
project actually resolves. Doc prose is omitted, so the block is API and
nothing else.

Use this INSTEAD of 'go doc <pkg>', which cannot answer the same question:
'go doc' renders a struct or interface as 'struct{ ... }' and lists no
methods at all, so 'go doc .../crud' never mentions crud.Repo.UpdateMasked.
'go doc -all <pkg>' is complete but roughly ten times larger, most of it
prose. Neither needs the source directory, and neither does reading files.

A selector naming a package or symbol that does not exist is an error listing
what does, so a briefing script whose list has gone stale fails loudly rather
than quietly shipping an incomplete API.

Examples:
  forge project libraries
  forge project libraries --json

		Args: cobra.ArbitraryArgs,
		RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
