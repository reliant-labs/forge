// `forge project libraries` must ANSWER "what does this package export",
// and must stop offering its source directory as the way to find out.
//
// WHY THESE TESTS EXIST — and why they are not the same tests as
// libraries_signatures_test.go, which already covers signature rendering.
//
// The signature RENDERER shipped 2026-07-31. A dogfood run twelve days
// later spent 35.5 minutes across 89 turns grepping forge's own pkg/ for
// signatures that renderer would have printed — `pkg/crud/repo.go` 14
// times, hunting `UpdateMasked` specifically. Three units wrote nothing at
// all; one made 145 bash calls with zero edits. Not one of them passed
// --signatures.
//
// So the gap was never rendering. It was two things this file pins:
//
//  1. REACHABILITY. The capability sat behind a flag, and a flag is
//     discovered by reading --help — which nobody does for a command they
//     believe they already understand. `forge project libraries crud` is
//     what a person types when they want crud's API.
//
//  2. THE DEAD END WE POINTED AT. The output named `go doc <pkg>` as the
//     route to a full API. It is not one: `go doc` renders a struct or
//     interface as `struct{ ... }` and lists no methods, so `go doc
//     .../crud` never mentions Repo.UpdateMasked at all. An agent that
//     followed our advice literally got a page that did not contain its
//     answer, and greping the source was the next honest move. That is
//     pinned by TestGoDoc_PackageViewOmitsMethods below, against the real
//     toolchain, so the claim we print stays true.
