// config-reach — `forge lint --config-reach`.
//
// A config field that NO PROCESS LOADS. Since configs became per-binary
// ((forge.v1.binary_config) = {binary: "<name>"}), a config message is
// loaded by exactly the binary it names — so a message annotated for a
// binary that was renamed or deleted, or a message nothing composes and
// nothing binds, still exists in config.proto, still generates Go, KCL
// and env projections, and is read by nobody.
//
// Before the split this could not happen: one AppConfig went to every
// binary, so "unused" meant "unread by Go code", never "unloaded". The
// motivating project shipped 69 fields to every binary; after splitting,
// a field that falls out of every binary's surface is invisible, because
// nothing errors — the generated code for it is simply never loaded.
//
// ── What it reports, and what it deliberately does NOT ────────────────
//
// It reports UNREACHABLE fields: fields on a config message that no
// binary and no frontend can load. Reachability is a graph question with
// an exact answer, which is what makes the check safe to run everywhere.
//
// It does NOT report "composed but never read in Go". That was the other
// candidate, and it was rejected on purpose: proving a config field is
// never read requires whole-program analysis through a generated typed
// struct that is passed by value into Deps, embedded in other structs,
// and reflected over by the flag registrar. Any tractable approximation
// (grep the field's Go name) is wrong in both directions — it misses
// reflective reads and flags fields read through a local alias — and a
// noisy answer to "is this field used?" is worse than no answer, because
// the fix it suggests is DELETING A FIELD. A narrow check with an exact
// answer beats a clever one that is sometimes right.
//
// ── Reachability model ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A config message is REACHABLE when any of these holds:
//
//	1. It names a binary that exists in cmd/            (binary-bound)
//	2. It names a frontend the project declares         (frontend-bound)
//	3. Some reachable message COMPOSES it, transitively (a shared block)
//	4. It is the PROJECT-GLOBAL ROOT config             (see below)
//
// Rule 4 is the one that matters most, and it is why a naive version of
// this check is dangerous. forge picks the FIRST unbound, uncomposed
// message as the project-global config — the `Config` alias that
// pkg/config.Load emits for (codegen: RootConfigMessage). The motivating
// project's AppConfig carries NO binary annotation for exactly this
// reason: it is in substance one binary's config, but it is also the
// root every subcommand and test helper calls. It has 75 fields. A check
// that flagged "composed by no binary" would report all 75 on the very
// project it was built for. Rule 4 is modeled after the generator's own
// selection so the check and the codegen agree by construction.
//
// ── Severity ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// WARNING. An unreachable field is dead weight, not a defect: nothing
// misbehaves, and the remediation is a DELETION, which is a judgment the
// author has to make (a field may be unreachable because the binary that
// loads it is being written this week). A lint that gates on "delete
// this" invites the wrong reflex.
//
// ── False positives deliberately avoided ──────────────────────────────
//
//   - THE UNANNOTATED ROOT AppConfig (rule 4 above).
//   - SHARED DEFINITION BLOCKS (BaseConfig) — reachable transitively;
//     this is the documented shared-config pattern.
//   - FRONTEND-BOUND messages, loaded by a bundle rather than a process.
//   - AN UNKNOWN BINARY/FRONTEND SET. If cmd/ cannot be enumerated the
//     check reports NOTHING rather than concluding every binary is
//     missing. "I could not tell" must never render as "it is dead" —
//     that is the same silent-wrongness this whole exercise is against.
//   - A project with no config messages, or no descriptor yet.
