//
// create-nullability — `forge lint --create-nullability`.
//
// A field's `optional` label is its PRESENCE contract, and
// Create<Entity>Request is the one CRUD envelope that FLATTENS the entity
// rather than nesting it. Flattening re-declares every field, which means
// the label has to be re-declared too — and a label that is dropped in the
// re-declaration fails in a way nothing else in the stack notices.
//
// Concretely: `optional string source_lead_id` on the entity generates Go
// `*string`, so absent is nil and distinguishable from "". Re-declared on
// the Create request WITHOUT the label it generates a plain `string`, and
// the two states collapse. The generated create then carries "" where the
// caller sent nothing, the insert writes "" into a nullable FK column, and
// postgres answers with a foreign-key violation at runtime — a failure
// whose message names a constraint, not the proto line that caused it.
// Worse, the honest-looking `if req.SourceLeadId != nil` guard in the
// generated op is dead code against a non-pointer: it reads as though
// presence were handled.
//
// The inverse direction is a bug too, and quieter: a field authored WITHOUT
// the label but declared `optional` on the Create request lets a caller
// omit a value the entity says is always present, and the zero value is
// written with no complaint.
//
// ── Why lint, and not (only) the birth path ───────────────────────────────
//
// Birth already gets this right: protoFieldDecl renders the label into the
// field's projected type, so a born Create request reproduces it
// (TestCreateRequestPreservesOptionalLabel pins the output). But birth is
// ONE-TIME. After it, the proto is the author's file — they add fields,
// change labels, hand-edit envelopes, and paste messages between services,
// and forge never reconciles the result. That is the intended contract, and
// it is exactly why the invariant needs a checker that runs continuously
// over what is on disk rather than only at the moment of writing.
//
// So this check is the safety net for two distinct populations: proto edits
// made after birth, and any future regression in the birth path itself.
//
// ── What it checks ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// For each message that has a sibling `Create<Entity>Request`, every field
// present in BOTH must agree on `optional`. The comparison is over the raw
// scan's parsed labels, not text, so spacing and comments do not matter.
//
// FALSE POSITIVES the check deliberately avoids:
//
//   - A read-only / computed field is ABSENT from the Create request by
//     design (the marker's whole purpose). Absent is not disagreement, and
//     the check only ever compares fields present on both sides — so the
//     omission is invisible to it rather than specially cased.
//   - A field the author deliberately left off the Create request (a
//     server-assigned value, a field write-able only through a custom RPC)
//     is likewise absent, and likewise not compared. The check never
//     demands that Create carry a field; it only demands that a field it
//     DOES carry agree about presence.
//   - `repeated` is not `optional` and is never compared against it: proto3
//     forbids `optional repeated`, so the labels are mutually exclusive and
//     a repeated field on both sides agrees with itself.
//   - Managed lifecycle fields (id / created_at / updated_at / deleted_at)
//     are server-owned and never on a write envelope; they are skipped
//     explicitly so a project that DOES list one cannot produce a finding
//     the author is not allowed to act on.
//   - A message with no Create request at all (a filter, a nested value
//     type, an envelope) is not an entity in this sense and is skipped.
//
// ── Severity follows provenance: who writes the create? ───────────────────
//
// Both harms above are harms of the GENERATED create: it is the generated
// op that copies "" into a nullable FK, and the generated op that writes a
// zero value for an omitted field. So the verdict depends on whether forge
// generates the op for this Create request, and forge can tell. A Create
// RPC forge wires has `crud.CreateOp[pb.Create<X>Request, …]` in a
// handlers_crud_ops_gen.go, and that file exists only when forge matched
// the RPC to a schema entity, validated its shape, and found no
// hand-written method pre-empting it. The ops file IS the provenance
// record; there is nothing to declare.
//
//	forge generates the op        both directions ERROR — the op is forge's,
//	                              and it silently corrupts writes.
//	hand-written handler,         NO FINDING. "Omit to get the server
//	  optional only on Create     default" is a contract the handler owns:
//	                              an auto-generated title, a default
//	                              value_type, append-at-end position,
//	                              base-branch detection. Demanding that the
//	                              label be dropped would destroy it.
//	hand-written handler,         WARNING. The wire really has lost
//	  optional only on entity     presence (the handler cannot tell omitted
//	                              from ""), but whether that matters is the
//	                              handler's call, so it does not gate.
//
// A project with no forge codegen (no forge.yaml, or a hand-written create)
// therefore never gates on this rule for a contract its own code keeps.
// Scoping by provenance beats asking every such project to repeat a
// suppression reason at each site, because the reason ("a handler owns this
// create") is a fact the tool can read.
//
// The name-only match against the ops file fails safe: a hand-written
// Create<X>Request in one proto package that shares its name with a
// generated one in another is judged as generated (error), never the
// reverse.
//
// Suppression: the ordinary engine (internal/linter/suppress), so an
// author overriding a generated op on purpose writes
// `// forge:lint-disable-next-line forgeconv-create-request-nullability: <why>`
// above the field, and a reasonless one is itself an error.
