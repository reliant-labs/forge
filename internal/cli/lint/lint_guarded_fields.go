// guarded-fields — `forge lint --guarded-fields`.
//
// `// forge:guards <table>.<column>` says a CUSTOM RPC owns a column's
// writes. The page generator honours it: the column comes off the scaffolded
// edit page's update_mask, so the form cannot write it raw. That covers
// every page forge emits from the moment the marker is written.
//
// It does not cover the pages already on disk, and that is what this rule is
// for.
//
// Scaffolded pages are WRITE-IF-ABSENT by design (see generateFrontendPages'
// "yours" contract): once forge has written a route it never writes that path
// again, no flag. So the realistic sequence — scaffold the CRUD pages, write
// the custom RPC, then add the marker once the guard exists — leaves an edit
// page whose mask still names the guarded column, and regenerating does
// nothing about it. The author has declared the guard, forge has agreed, and
// the form still bypasses it.
//
// Nothing else catches that:
//
//   - `forge generate` is silent: it skipped the file, which is correct.
//   - The frontend builds and typechecks. The column is a real field on a
//     real request; writing it is well-typed.
//   - No test fails. The generated CRUD lifecycle tests exercise the RPCs,
//     not the page.
//
// The symptom is a user editing a form and getting a 500 out of a raw CHECK
// constraint — the exact failure the marker was introduced to prevent,
// surviving in the one place regeneration cannot reach.
//
// ── What it reads, and why it is a text scan ─────────────────────────────
//
// Two halves, correlated:
//
//  1. The guards. Read off the proto SOURCE with codegen.GuardTargets, the
//     same grammar the descriptor path uses, so the check and the generator
//     cannot disagree about what a target is. Source rather than descriptor
//     because a marker added but not yet generated is precisely the state
//     this rule reports on.
//  2. The masks. Read off the scaffolded edit pages as text: the emitted
//     mask is a literal (`paths: ["a", "b"]`) written by forge's own
//     template, so the shape is known exactly rather than guessed. Parsing
//     TSX properly would need a TypeScript toolchain this process does not
//     have, and would buy nothing — a hand-rewritten page that no longer
//     has that literal is a page the user now owns, and silence is the
//     right answer for it.
//
// The table half of the target is matched against the page's ROUTE SLUG, not
// against a schema introspection. The slug is derived from the entity name
// by the same naming rules that produce the table name, so `invoices` in the
// marker and `src/app/invoices/[id]/edit/page.tsx` on disk are the same
// fact — and it means the rule needs neither a database nor a migration
// parse. A page whose slug resolves to no guard is silent.
//
// As with its read-only twin, a case this scan cannot resolve yields
// SILENCE, not a finding: a rule that misses one defect costs one defect,
// while a rule that invents one costs every future finding it would have
// reported.
//
// Severity is warning. The fix is an edit to a file the USER owns — forge
// must not rewrite it — so gating the build on it would block a project on
// a change only a human can make.
