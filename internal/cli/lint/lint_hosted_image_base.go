// hosted-image-base — reports a host-bearing image on a forge.OnHosted item.
//
// A hosted workload's registry is NOT the author's to choose (ADR-0003 F1):
// the platform admits images from exactly one subtree,
// `<registry_host>/<org>/<project>`, and refuses every other. So
// forge resolves a bare `image = "api"` against the base composed from the org
// the credential acts for,
// and an author who writes a host is transcribing a value forge already
// composes — which is fine when they get it right and a publish-time refusal
// when they do not.
//
// This is where that is noticed early. `forge env render <env>` performs the
// authoritative version of the same check against the real render; this one
// is the cheap, offline approximation over the deploy KCL text, so it covers
// every env in the project rather than the one someone is deploying.
//
// AN OFF-BASE IMAGE IS A WARNING, and the asymmetry with render is
// deliberate. A render is what a deploy applies, so manifests the platform
// will reject make that render a document nobody can act on — it fails. A
// lint judges a project, including envs nobody is deploying, where the same
// fact is something to fix rather than something to stop for. And the text
// scan under-reports by construction (internal/hostedimage/scan.go says how),
// so it is not a gate anything should depend on being complete.
//
