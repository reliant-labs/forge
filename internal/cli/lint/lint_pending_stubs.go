//
// Pending-stub mode — the one deterministic exception to the two
// unwritten-column rules (forgeconv-read-only-field-unwritten and
// forgeconv-computed-field-unwritten) failing the build.
//
// Both rules fail `forge lint` when a `forge:read-only` or `forge:computed`
// field has no write path. That verdict is right for code a person wrote and
// wrong for the state forge itself leaves behind: right after
// `forge scaffold`, the custom rpc that will set the column (a
// ChangeJobStatus, a RecalculateEstimate) is still forge's own placeholder —
// a method stamped `// forge:gen unwired-stub` that returns Unimplemented.
// Failing the gate on forge's fresh output makes the scaffold phase's
// expected state illegal, so every agent learns to read the read-only lint as
// noise at exactly the moment it is about to matter.
//
// So while the service that declares the entity still has forge-scaffolded
// stubs in its handler package, a finding is a WARNING naming them —
// "pending: implement ChangeJobStatus, ScheduleJob". Once none remain, it is
// an error again.
//
// ── Why the whole package, and not "the rpc that writes this column" ──────
//
// Which rpc writes which column is a dataflow question this lint cannot
// answer from text, and guessing it (by rpc name, by request shape) is the
// name-derived inference forge does not do. The stub marker is a fact forge
// stamped itself, so "does this service still carry forge's placeholders?"
// has a definite answer, and the finding names the stubs it is waiting on so
// the reader can see the reason rather than trust it. The cost of the coarse
// grain is one service with an unrelated stub keeping its findings at
// warning — visible on every run, and cleared by the same act (implementing
// the stub) that clears the scaffold-not-customized warning beside it.
