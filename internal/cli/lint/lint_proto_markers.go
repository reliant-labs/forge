// proto-markers — `forge lint --proto-markers`.
//
// A `forge:*` PROTO comment marker that is misspelled, or simply not a
// marker forge recognizes, does NOTHING today — the comment is valid proto,
// buf compiles it, and forge's scanners look for exact known markers and
// find none. `// forge:server-set` (the spelling forge used before the
// marker was renamed to `forge:read-only`) is the motivating case: it reads
// as an ordinary comment, the field stays client-writable on Create and
// Update, and the birth exits zero with no warning. The author believes they
// declared something; nothing did.
//
// That is the same silent-failure shape the sibling column-markers check
// (lint_column_markers.go) exists to prevent, one layer up: SQL catalog
// comments there, proto comments here.
//
// This check flags any `//` comment in a .proto file whose text contains
// `forge:` but matches none of codegen.KnownProtoMarkers — the SAME registry
// the scanners themselves spell their markers from and that
// `forge project annotations` dumps, so the marker vocabulary this check
// enforces and the vocabulary forge actually reads cannot drift apart.
//
// Severity is warning, never gating: an unrecognized marker might be a future
// forge version's, or simply prose that happens to contain "forge:" in an
// unrelated comment ("see forge:entity docs", a URL, a commit reference). The
// finding is a nudge to check the spelling, not a hard failure — the same
// trade the column check makes explicitly.
//
// FALSE POSITIVES the scan deliberately avoids, beyond that blanket
// acceptance:
//
//   - Entity-level (leading comment above `message X {`) and field-level
//     (leading OR trailing on the field) markers live in different comment
//     positions, and BOTH are legitimate. This check therefore validates the
//     marker NAME only and never its position — a placement rule would have
//     to model the proto grammar to avoid being wrong, and the birth path
//     already refuses an unconsumed forge:read-only by name and line.
//   - Different passes read different markers (forge:mutation on every
//     generate, forge:secret in the descriptor path only, the rest at birth).
//     The registry is the UNION across passes, so a marker one scanner has
//     never heard of is still recognized here.
//   - A `forge:` inside a proto STRING literal (a default value, an option
//     value) is not a comment and is never scanned.
