//
// read-only-fields — `forge lint --read-only-fields`.
//
// The twin of forgeconv-computed-field-unwritten, for the marker where the
// same failure is SILENT.
//
// `// forge:read-only` says a field is not CLIENT-writable, and its only
// mechanical effect is a wire-shape omission: the field is stripped from
// the born Create and Update requests. It says nothing about who writes the
// column instead, and forge — correctly — writes nothing. So a read-only
// column that no app code populates takes its column DEFAULT, and for the
// money columns this happens to most (`total_cents`, `balance_cents`,
// `subtotal_cents`) that default is 0.
//
// Nothing catches it, and that is the whole point of the rule:
//
//   - No constraint is violated. 0 is a perfectly legal BIGINT.
//   - No test fails. The generated CRUD lifecycle test derives its fixtures
//     from the same schema, so it round-trips the zero it just stored and
//     agrees with the defect by construction.
//   - No error is logged, anywhere.
//
// The single symptom is a human reading a screen that says $0.00. In the
// audited run this was found only because the workflow made the agent read
// every .up.sql and ask "what writes this?" — luck of process. Had it not,
// the app would have shipped with every estimate total and every invoice
// balance at zero.
//
// ── Why this is not just the computed rule with a wider marker set ────────
//
// forge:computed declares an OBLIGATION, so its check can be blunt: the
// author said something derives this, and nothing does. forge:read-only
// declares no such thing — many read-only columns are legitimately
// populated by a DEFAULT that means something, by postgres itself, or by
// forge's own managed-timestamp machinery. Applied bluntly to read-only,
// the same check fires on `created_at` for every entity in the project,
// which is precisely how a lint earns a blanket disable and stops
// protecting the one case that mattered.
//
// So the schema is consulted, and a finding requires ALL of:
//
//  1. the field carries `forge:read-only` (NOT `forge:computed` — that one
//     is forgeconv-computed-field-unwritten's, and reporting one defect
//     under two rule ids with two fix hints teaches authors to ignore both);
//  2. the column's DEFAULT is absent or is the type's zero value — a real
//     default like `'draft'` or `5` is evidence somebody chose the value;
//  3. the column is NOT `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...) STORED` — postgres
//     writes those on every insert and update, and it is the very fix this
//     rule recommends;
//  4. the column is not NOT NULL-with-no-DEFAULT — codegen's
//     FindUnsatisfiableColumns already FAILS `forge generate` on exactly
//     that shape, and a warning beside a hard error reads like the softer
//     of two verdicts;
//  5. the column declares no `forge:fill=` strategy — that marker already
//     answers the question this rule asks;
//  6. the column is not one of forge's managed columns (created_at,
//     updated_at, deleted_at), which pkg/crud stamps from generated code
//     the Go scan deliberately cannot see;
//  7. no non-generated, non-test Go file assigns the Go field name, AND no
//     SQL assigns the COLUMN name — a trigger body's `NEW.col := …` or an
//     `UPDATE … SET col = …`, in a migration or in a Go string literal.
//     Those are real write paths the AST scan structurally cannot see,
//     because none of them spells the protoc-gen-go field identifier it
//     searches for. See columnsWrittenBySQL.
//
// ── Why the schema is read as TEXT ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// schemadef.ApplyAndIntrospect is the authoritative answer, and it needs a
// real postgres to apply the migrations to. A lint that requires a database
// cannot run in the half-finished state where this defect actually lives,
// and `forge lint` has no shadow server of its own. So DEFAULT / GENERATED
// / NOT NULL are parsed out of db/migrations the same way the sibling
// crud-fixtures check reads foreign keys, replaying files in lexical order
// so a later ALTER wins.
//
// The trade is that a column this parser cannot resolve yields SILENCE, not
// a finding — see readOnlyColumnsFromMigrations. That direction is chosen
// deliberately: a rule that misses a case costs one defect, while a rule
// that invents one costs every future finding it would have reported.
//
// ── Severity: this rule GATES ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It was warnings-only, matching its computed-field twin, and that was
// backwards relative to the argument above. The whole case for the check is
// that the defect "ships as $0.00 with no error, no failing test, and no log
// line anywhere" — and a warning inside a hundred-line lint run is very
// close to no log line anywhere. The audited project caught its two only
// because someone was deliberately looking for them.
//
// The asymmetry with forge:computed is deliberate, not an oversight.
// forge:computed declares an obligation the author has not met YET, so a
// project mid-migration (marker added before the hook) is a legitimate
// intermediate state and warning is right. An unwritten read-only column is
// not an intermediate state; it is a shipped defect.
//
// A gating rule that fires wrongly is far worse than a warning that does,
// so every exclusion above is pinned by a test, and the two write paths
// this check could not previously see were closed BEFORE the verdict
// changed (see lint_read_only_fields_gating_test.go).
//
// The escape hatch is `COMMENT ON COLUMN <table>.<col> IS
// 'forge:fill=handler'`, and it is deliberately the only one. A severity
// dial would let a project silence the rule without answering its question;
// the marker makes the author state WHO populates the column, which is a
// fact the next reader needs and the answer the rule was asking for. Note
// that `lint.rules` does NOT reach this check — those severities are
// applied to finding.Finding values, and this step emits its own report —
// so the marker is not merely preferred, it is the mechanism.
