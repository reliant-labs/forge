// time-bucketing — `forge lint --time-bucketing`.
//
// The reporting-query twin of read-only-fields: a defect that produces
// wrong numbers with no error, no failing test and no log line anywhere.
//
// forge maps `google.protobuf.Timestamp` to `TIMESTAMPTZ`, which is
// correct — an instant should be stored as an instant. But the moment a
// reporting query buckets one:
//
//	date_trunc('day', recorded_at)
//
// postgres truncates in the SESSION's timezone, and the driver sets that
// from the CLIENT HOST. So "distance per day" silently means a different
// day depending on where the server process happens to run. Measured
// against real postgres over five samples spanning two UTC calendar days
// (pkg/pgtest/datetrunc_premise_pg_test.go):
//
//	session TZ=UTC               2 buckets
//	session TZ=America/New_York  2 buckets, boundaries at 05:00Z
//	session TZ=Asia/Tokyo        3 buckets
//
// Same rows, same query, three different answers. The three-argument form
// pins the zone in the query and returns 2 under every session zone:
//
//	date_trunc('day', recorded_at, 'UTC')
//
// ── Why this is worth a rule ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Nothing fails. No constraint is violated, no type error is raised, no
// test breaks — a weekly chart still renders, its bars merely attributed
// to the wrong days by a fraction of a day that CHANGES when the app is
// deployed to a differently-configured host. A CI box on UTC and a laptop
// on UTC-5 produce different numbers from identical rows, which reads as
// flakiness rather than as a timezone bug, so the investigation starts in
// the wrong place.
//
// It is also squarely in forge's path rather than incidental to it. The
// generated ORM cannot express GROUP BY / SUM, so forge itself routes
// authors to raw SQL for any reporting screen — which is exactly where
// this construct lives.
//
// ── What it reads ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Purely textual, no database, matching read-only-fields and
// fixture-drift. Two SQL sources:
//
//   - Go string literals in non-generated, non-test source. A handler's
//     query is a string constant, so the literal IS the query.
//   - The project's .up.sql migrations, where a reporting VIEW lives once
//     the query stops being ad-hoc.
//
// Column types come from the same migration replay the read-only rule
// depends on (readOnlyColumnsFromMigrations), so the two agree exactly on
// what the schema says.
//
// ── The exclusions, and why each one exists ──────────────────────────────
//
// A rule that invents findings gets globally disabled, and then every real
// signal it would have reported is lost too. A rule that misses a case
// costs one defect. So every ambiguity resolves to SILENCE:
//
//  1. THREE arguments → silent. That is the fix. Firing on it would tell
//     the author to undo the correct thing. A named zone other than UTC is
//     equally silent: the author has stated the zone, which is the entire
//     thing this rule asks for.
//  2. The truncated argument is not a bare column reference → silent. A
//     cast, a function call, a placeholder, or `AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'` all
//     have types this text parse cannot read — and the last of those is
//     itself a correct fix, since it converts to TIMESTAMP first.
//  3. The column resolves to no declared type → silent. A gap in this
//     parser is not evidence about the app.
//  4. The column is TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE → silent. Postgres
//     truncates the stored wall-clock value; every host agrees. Verified
//     alongside the firing case.
//  5. The column name is declared with CONFLICTING types across tables →
//     silent. A bare `recorded_at` cannot be attributed to a table from
//     text, and guessing would report a correct query half the time.
//     Columns are resolved by NAME rather than by table precisely because
//     the enclosing FROM clause is not reliably parseable from a fragment;
//     requiring agreement across every declaration is what makes that
//     sound.
//  6. The unit is not a string literal → silent. A runtime unit might be
//     'minute'.
//  7. The unit is finer than an hour → silent. Every offset in the tz
//     database is a whole number of minutes, so a minute or second bucket
//     cannot straddle a zone boundary.
//
// ── Severity: warning, never gating ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Matching fixture-drift, crud-fixtures and guarded-fields. Unlike the
// read-only rule — which gates because an unwritten column is
// unambiguously a defect — a local-time bucket can be exactly what the
// author wants for a shift report or a business-day rollup. The rule's job
// is to make the choice visible, not to make it for them.
