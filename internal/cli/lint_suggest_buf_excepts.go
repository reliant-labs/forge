// `forge lint --suggest-buf-excepts` walks the project's .proto files,
// runs `buf lint`, and prints a buf.yaml `lint.except:` snippet
// suggesting which STANDARD rules to silence for a port-in-progress
// codebase.
//
// Migration projects (a Connect API spec ported from a pre-forge repo)
// routinely hit the same handful of STANDARD rules: PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX
// when the original namespace was `foo.v1` vs the buf-canonical
// `foo.v1`, RPC_REQUEST_STANDARD_NAME when the RPCs predate the
// `<Method>Request` convention, FIELD_LOWER_SNAKE_CASE when fields
// were snake_case-with-acronyms, etc. The hint at the end of
// `forge lint` (printBufLintExceptHint) already nudges the user
// toward the four most common offenders, but the nudge is a static
// list — it can't tell which rules ACTUALLY fire in the user's tree.
//
// This command runs `buf lint` and aggregates the output by rule
// name, then prints the rules that fired across more than the
// `--threshold` (default 3) files. The heuristic is intentionally
// conservative: a single .proto with one violation is probably a
// real bug to fix; the same violation across many files is almost
// always a port-wide convention mismatch best resolved via except.
//
// The output is YAML-shaped so the user can paste it directly into
// buf.yaml. Nothing is mutated.
//
// FRICTION 2026-06-02: cp-forge proto port — author hit
// FIELD_LOWER_SNAKE_CASE on 40+ files and had to grep buf output
// manually to count rule occurrences before deciding what to except.
