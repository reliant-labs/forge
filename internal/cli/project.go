// forge versions (`migrate`, `upgrade`), or INSPECT it (`map`, `graph`,
// `introspect`, `features`, `annotations`, plus `audit` from the factory
// registry). That is as opposed to acting on a deploy environment
// (`forge env ...`) or being an everyday dev verb (`forge build/test/lint`).
//
// Scaffolding deliberately does NOT live here: writing new code into a
// project is `forge scaffold` (bare = everything the protos imply, with a
// noun = one thing). `project` carried no information for those verbs —
// every forge command operates on a project.
