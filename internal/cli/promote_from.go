// `promote --from <env> [--from-promotion <id>]`: promote exactly what another
// environment is running (control-plane docs/design/hosted-deploy-primitives.md
// §3.4).
//
// THE RACE THIS CLOSES, AND WHY THE SERVER RESOLVES THE VERSION. "Promote
// whatever staging runs" done entirely client-side is two calls: read
// staging's current release, then promote that version to prod. If staging is
// promoted between the two, prod gets a release that was NEVER the one
// approved — and may still be rolling out on staging — and the client cannot
// tell that it happened. So forge does not send a version it resolved and
// call that provenance. It sends `from_promotion_id`: the promotion its
// decision was made against. The server re-reads that promotion under the
// TARGET environment's lock, takes the version from it, and refuses
// `source_moved` if it is no longer what the source runs (C6). The read below
// therefore feeds the PLAN — the preview a human reads — while the write's
// authority stays server-side, where a lock can back it.
//
// WHY A PROMOTION ID AND NOT A VERSION. A version label is ambiguous about
// time: staging may have run v1.4.0, moved to v1.5.0, and rolled forward to
// v1.4.1. An id names exactly one entry, so "the build QA signed off on" and
// "what staging happens to run now" cannot be confused for each other.
//
// SAME CONTROL PLANE ONLY. See promoteFromGuardError.
