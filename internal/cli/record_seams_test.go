// The bundle recorder seam F4 left narrow, now that it carries what the
// hosted RPC requires — plus the one apply property that survives.
//
// WHAT IS ACTUALLY UNDER TEST. The widening exists to close a failure that
// COMPILES: a seam that cannot carry the bundle's own bytes forces a client
// to DESCRIBE the bundle instead, and every reader downstream then trusts the
// description over the artifact. So the first test asserts on the REQUEST
// BODY, not only the return value — both what is present and what must be
// absent.
//
// The apply-guard tests that stood here are GONE, not moved. They pinned a
// compare-and-set forge sent when forge was the actuator; forge does not
// apply, so there is no such request to assert on. What remains is F-2, which
// is a property of the RECORD rather than of any apply forge performs: an
// apply that began and never reported must not block the next one.
