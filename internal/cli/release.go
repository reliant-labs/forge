// The release ledger + env→release binding are the "build once → promote"
// spine described in the artifact-pipeline design. They sit ABOVE the
// per-image digest foundation that already shipped (build_state.go captures
// a digest per pushed image; deploy.go resolveDeployImageDigests pins each
// service's manifest to its own `@sha256:...`). This file adds the layer
// that lets a SINGLE build feed MANY envs:
//
//	forge env build --release v1.4.0   → builds the env-agnostic images ONCE,
//	                                  records each image's digest in a
//	                                  Release ledger (.forge/releases/<v>.json).
//	forge env deploy prod v1.4.0 → appends a promotion of prod → v1.4.0 to
//	                                  the env's append-only ledger
//	                                  (.forge/promotions/prod.jsonl, or the
//	                                  hosted control plane). No rebuild.
//	forge env deploy prod              → if prod is bound, pins the SAME digests
//	                                  the promotion froze (build once, promote);
//	                                  else falls back to the per-env build state.
//
// Scope: forge's build produces "shared" images (one digest, every env) and
// "source" frontends (a pinned commit). release.ModeVariant is representable
// and validated, but nothing here produces or deploys one yet.

// releasesDirRel was ".forge/releases", one file per version INSIDE the
// checkout. It is gone: see retiredReleasesDirRel in ledger_unimported.go,
// which is the only remaining reference to that location and treats it as
// history to be imported rather than as a ledger.

// The release TYPES live in forge/pkg/release, not here. What remains in this
// file is the build-time HARVEST that produces a release (reading the
// per-image digests the build captured) — not its storage, which belongs to
// whichever ledger the env selected. The two stores
// (internal/ledgerfile and hosted_ledger.go) read and write the same types,
// so "what forge cut" and "what the control plane stores" are one vocabulary
// rather than two structs kept in step by
// comments.

// releaseFileStem maps a release version label to its on-disk ledger
// filename stem (without the .json extension). It is the SINGLE mapping
// build (write), promote (read), and deploy (read) all funnel through via
// releasePath, so they always agree on which file a version names.
//
// Unlike statefile.SafeSegment — which flattens EVERY non-[A-Za-z0-9_-]
// byte to '_', turning the common semver "v1.0.0" into the surprising
// "v1_0_0.json" a user never looks for — this preserves the dot, because a
// dot IS filesystem-safe and keeping it makes the literal version the
// filename ("v1.0.0" → "v1.0.0.json"): least surprise. Path separators
// ('/', '\') and any other unsafe byte still flatten to '_' so the write
// can never escape .forge/releases. The lone exception is the traversal
// token "." / ".." (or a name that is only dots): a dot-only stem is a
// directory reference, not a release, so it flattens to underscores. In
// practice version labels never hit that case — it's a pure safety guard.
func releaseFileStem(version string) string {

// releasePath, WriteRelease and ReadRelease ARE DELETED. They were the

//
// Releases now live in the ledger the env selected — the control plane, or
// the machine store under $FORGE_LEDGER_HOME (internal/ledgerfile) — and are
// reached through the releaseLedger seam (Cut, Get, List), so no caller
// resolves a version to a path any more. The immutability rule those two
// functions enforced did not move: release.CheckRecut is still the one
// implementation, called by both stores.
//
// releaseFileStem survives above because reading the RETIRED location is
// still necessary — not as a ledger, but to detect a checkout whose

//     digest.
//   - every per-service .forge/state/build-<env>-<service>.json the external-
//     build dispatcher writes — each external image's own digest.
//
// Reusing the existing digest capture is the whole point: the release ledger is
// a DURABLE projection of the ephemeral build state, not a parallel capture
// mechanism. Every harvested image becomes a "shared" artifact (one digest,
// promoted to all envs) — the MVP scope.

// Firebase Hosting SPA declared via forge.GitSource is built from a pinned

// is not cosmetic. Such a frontend has no promotion record, no staleness
// check, and no entry a deploy could verify; its only pin is a ref string in
// KCL that nothing reconciles, so it drifts out of step with the API it talks
// to while every image around it advances correctly. Recording it here makes
// the release cover the environment rather than a subset of it.
//
// The pin is resolved through the SAME gitsource resolver the build and
// deploy paths use, so the commit recorded is the commit those paths would
