// Non-OCI artifact harvesting.
//
// harvestReleaseArtifacts (release.go) projects the container images a build
// pushed. This file does the same job for the three other things a release
// ships — npm packages, Go modules, and published files — and it holds to the
// same rule, which is the load-bearing property of the whole model: THE LEDGER
// IS A PROJECTION OF BUILD STATE, NOT A PARALLEL CAPTURE MECHANISM. Every
// coordinate below is read out of something the build or the repo already
// produced. Nothing here builds, publishes, or mutates anything.
//
// Why this matters concretely: forge v0.1.12 tagged `web-runtime/v0.3.1` and
// never published it to npm. The ledger could not say "this release also
// contains an npm package at this version with this integrity hash", so
// nothing compared the two, and the gap surfaced as a scaffolded project
// failing to install. Naming the artifact is the prerequisite for verifying it.
//
// ABSENCE IS NOT FAILURE. A project with no npm package, no nested Go module
// and no build-only binaries harvests nothing from this file, and that is a
// normal release, not an error. Every function here is best-effort: a missing
// tool, an unreadable manifest or a failed subprocess yields no artifact and
// no error. Only a release with NOTHING AT ALL is a problem, and that check
// already lives in writeReleaseLedger.

// releaseScanSkipDirs are directory names never descended into when scanning a
// project for package manifests. They are either dependency trees (node_modules,
// vendor) or build output (dist, build, out, .next, bin) — a manifest found
// inside one describes something the project consumes or emits a copy of, not
// something it releases. Skipping them also keeps the scan bounded on a large
// monorepo, where node_modules alone dwarfs the real source tree.

// publish — byte-for-byte the string the registry serves back as
// `dist.integrity`, which is what makes it verifiable later.
//
// WHY npm pack AND NOT THE REGISTRY. Reading the registry's metadata would
// describe what is ALREADY published, and at the moment a release is cut that
// is either nothing (404) or the PREVIOUS version — so the ledger would record
// a hash for bytes this release did not produce. That is not a hypothetical
// mis-step: it is precisely the v0.1.12 failure shape, where the tag existed
// and the publish did not, and a registry read would have cheerfully recorded
// v0.3.0's hash under v0.3.1. npm pack describes the bytes ON DISK RIGHT NOW,
// which is what "the artifacts of this build" means. (package-lock.json, the
// third candidate source, describes the package's DEPENDENCIES, not itself.)
//
// WHY --ignore-scripts IS LOAD-BEARING. Without it, npm runs the `prepare`
// lifecycle script, which for forge's own web-runtime is a full rebuild. That
// would make the ledger a capture mechanism that PRODUCES the artifact it
// claims to be observing — the exact inversion this model forbids, and a way
// for a release to record bytes that were never tested. With it, pack reads
// the dist/ the build already emitted. Verified on web-runtime: both spellings
// yield an identical integrity hash, and --ignore-scripts is ~7x faster.
//
// Shelling out is consistent with the OCI path, which reads digests via
// `docker buildx imagetools inspect`; npm is the tool that owns the tarball
// format, and reimplementing its packing rules would be a second source of
// truth that silently disagrees.
//
// Unauthenticated by construction: `npm pack` on a local directory touches no
// registry and needs no token. Best-effort throughout — no npm on PATH, a
