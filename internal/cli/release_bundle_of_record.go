// ONE BUNDLE PER (ENV, RELEASE): the bundle recorded first is the release's
// bundle, and every later write for the same release reuses it verbatim.
//
// WHY. A bundle is what a reviewer inspects and what a Flux applies, so "the
// bundle a plan was computed from" and "the bundle that deploys" must be one
// object. On 2026-10-07 they were not: the cut recorded sha256:a2564b5253b2,
// the next --plan-only recorded sha256:4645278bf09a for the same release, and
// that second one is what deployed. Pulled and compared, the two carried
// byte-identical manifests (one layer, sha256:7627821e8cb5) and differed only
// in metadata: the plan's carried the release's source pins, and it named a
// different forge as the renderer. So every plan re-recorded, and an approval
// was bound to whichever binary computed it.
//
// THE IDENTITY IS THE RENDERED OBJECTS, not the bundle digest. A bundle also
// records who rendered it (provenance.forge_version) and when, and those are
// facts about the first render, not differences in what ships. Two renders
// whose objects match are the same bundle, and the recorded one is reused —
// its digest, its record, its provenance. Two renders whose objects differ are
// two different deploys, and writing the second under the same release would
// make the release mean whichever was written last. That is refused, naming
// the objects that differ, unless the caller re-records on purpose.
//
// WHERE THE RECORD IS FOUND:
//   - a pushed HOSTED bundle: the registry tag release-<version> in the env's
//     bundle repository. The control plane has no (env, release) lookup, and
//     the registry is where the bytes are, so the tag is set right after a
//     successful record and read back here.
//   - otherwise: the machine ledger's oldest bundle row for (env, release),
//     which carries the shape it recorded.
