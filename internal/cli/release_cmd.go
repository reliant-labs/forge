		Use:   "verify <version>",
		Short: "Prove every artifact a release names actually exists and matches",
		Long: `Check that every artifact named in a release ledger really exists in its
public registry, and that its bytes match what the ledger recorded.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A ledger that NAMES an artifact is a claim, not a fact. forge
v0.1.12 tagged its web runtime at 0.3.1, recorded the integrity hash of the
tarball on the build machine, and never published it. Nothing compared the two,
so the gap surfaced days later as a scaffolded project failing to install. This
command is that comparison.

WHAT IS CHECKED, PER KIND:

  oci    the registry serves a manifest at the recorded digest. A digest is
         content-addressed, so existence IS the byte check.
  npm    the registry has that exact version AND its dist.integrity equals the
         recorded hash. A mismatch means different bytes shipped under a
         version number that is now permanently taken.
  gomod  the public checksum database has that version AND its h1: module hash
         equals the recorded one.
  file   reported UNVERIFIABLE — nothing yet records where a file artifact is
         published, so there is no URL to fetch.

NO CREDENTIALS. Every read is an anonymous request to a public registry. That
is deliberate: if proving a release were to require a login, only the operator
of that login could prove it, and the check would stop being independently
verifiable by the person who most needs it.

THREE OUTCOMES, NOT TWO:

  VERIFIED      the artifact exists and matches.
  FAILED        proven wrong — absent, or present with different bytes.
  UNVERIFIABLE  a structural gap makes the check impossible (a file artifact
                with no publish URL, a private Go module, an OCI artifact whose
                ledger names no registry). Says nothing about validity.
  UNREACHABLE   the check could not complete — a timeout, DNS failure, or a
                registry demanding credentials. Transient; retry may verify.

EXIT CODES:

  0  nothing failed
  1  at least one artifact FAILED, or --strict was set and something was
     UNVERIFIABLE
  2  a check could not COMPLETE (UNREACHABLE) and nothing outright failed

Exit 2 is separate from 1 on purpose. A network blip is not evidence against a
release, and a gate that reports a missing artifact and a flaky DNS lookup with
the same code is a gate that gets switched off the first week it is wrong.

Examples:
  forge release verify v1.4.0              # check every artifact
  forge release verify v1.4.0 --strict     # also fail on anything unverifiable
  forge release verify v1.4.0 --timeout 1m # slow or distant registry
  forge release verify v1.4.0 --json       # machine-readable, same exit codes

--json emits the same verdicts as a document, with the ledger's git provenance
alongside them. Read the git.dirty field: a release cut from a tree with
uncommitted changes ships bytes that correspond to no reviewable commit, which
no per-artifact check can detect. The four statuses stay four values —
"unverifiable" is not "verified".`,
