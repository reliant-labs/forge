// File: internal/cli/release_go_proxy_wait_test.go
//
// Exercises scripts/wait-for-go-proxy.sh, the post-push gate that stops a
// release commit from failing every downstream job for ~6 minutes.
//
// WHY THESE TESTS EXIST. `git push --atomic` returns as soon as GitHub has
// the tag; proxy.golang.org discovers it by polling, and sum.golang.org only
// records a hash after the proxy has fetched the tree. So there is a window —
// measured in minutes, not seconds — in which the tag exists and
// `go mod download <module>@<version>` 404s for the whole world. E2E Scaffold
// scaffolds a project that requires the new version and runs `go mod tidy`,
// so it fails on every single release commit for a release that is entirely
// correct.
//
// TestWaitForGoProxy_RaceUnwaitedResolutionFails is the reproduction: it
// models what the release flow does TODAY (resolve immediately after the
// push) and asserts that it fails. It is the test that must go red against
// current behaviour and green once the wait is in the flow.
//
// The other properties are the ones a human reading CI output depends on:
// the loop keeps waiting well past the first few probes, it does not declare
// success on the proxy alone while the checksum db is still empty, and a
// timeout names WHICH of the two very different states it is in — because
// "tagged but late" and "the tag never landed" have opposite remedies, and
// telling someone to re-cut a tag that is merely late burns the version
// permanently.
//
// Every case is hermetic: GOPROXY_WAIT_BASE / GOSUMDB_WAIT_BASE point at an
// httptest server and the window env vars shrink minutes to milliseconds.
// Nothing here touches the network.
