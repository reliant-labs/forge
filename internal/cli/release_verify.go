// Release verification: proving a ledger's claims against the public world.
//
// A release ledger NAMES artifacts. Until this file, nothing checked that the
// named thing exists. That gap is not theoretical: forge v0.1.12 tagged
// `web-runtime/v0.3.1`, never published it to npm, and the ledger recorded a
// version alongside an integrity hash that no registry had ever served. The
// defect surfaced days later as a scaffolded project failing to install.
//
// Two properties make this trustworthy, and both are constraints on the
// design rather than features of it:
//
// NO CREDENTIALS. Every check reads a PUBLIC registry anonymously — npmjs.org,
// sum.golang.org, and an OCI registry's anonymous pull token. Nothing here
// reads a forge account, a hosted store, or a login. That is deliberate: the
// moment proof depends on a service we operate, "is this release real" becomes
// a question only we can answer, and the answer stops being independently
// checkable by the person who most needs it. An artifact's existence is a fact
// about the public internet, and it is verified against the public internet.
//
// NOTHING IS SILENTLY PASSED. A check that could not run reports that it could
// not run. See verifyStatus — the three-state model is the whole point, and
// collapsing it to pass/fail is the specific way a verifier becomes worse than
// no verifier at all.

// verifyStatus is the outcome of checking ONE artifact.
//
// THREE OUTCOMES, NEVER TWO. A boolean verifier has to file everything it
// could not check under one of "passed" or "failed", and both choices are
// lies with consequences. Filing it under passed means a green run that
// proves nothing — exactly the state v0.1.12 shipped in. Filing it under
// failed means the command is red for conditions nobody can fix (a file
// artifact has no publish destination because forge never records one), and a
// gate that is permanently red gets deleted from CI within a week.
//
// So "could not check" is its own answer, and it is further split by CAUSE,
// because the two causes call for opposite responses: a STRUCTURAL gap is a
// property of the ledger that will still be there tomorrow, while an
// UNREACHABLE network is transient and says nothing whatsoever about the
// artifact. Conflating them is what turns a verifier into a flaky gate.
