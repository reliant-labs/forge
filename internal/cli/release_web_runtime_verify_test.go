//
// Exercises scripts/verify-npm-published.sh, the post-publish guard in
// .github/workflows/release-web-runtime.yml.
//
// WHY THESE TESTS EXIST. The guard used to be inline YAML, which meant it had
// never been run against a registry that refuses — and it was wrong. Its
// window was ~60s, on the assumption that npm propagation is near-instant.
// 0.3.2 published successfully and was not served for several minutes, so the
// guard failed a release that had worked, and said the artifact was missing
// when it was merely late.
//
// That is the failure mode worth pinning: a guard that cries wolf is not a
// harmless over-caution. It burns a release slot and it teaches people to
// disbelieve the one check that catches the real drift (a tag with no
// artifact, which is how web-runtime/v0.3.1 shipped).
//
// So the properties under test are the two that a human reading CI output
// depends on: the loop KEEPS WAITING past the old 60s ceiling, and a timeout
// names which of the two very different states it is in.
//
// Every case is hermetic and fast: NPM_VIEW_CMD points the script at a stub
// instead of the registry, and the window env vars shrink minutes to
// milliseconds. Nothing here touches the network.
