// File: internal/cli/resolveport_store_test.go
//
// Pins the DOCUMENTED behavior of `resolve_port` against its real behavior,
// so the two cannot drift apart again.
//
// The scaffolded deploy/kcl/dev/main.k tells the reader, at length:
//
//	plugin.resolve_port(name, preferred) is AVAILABILITY-CHECKED. It takes
//	`preferred` when free, steps to the next free port when not, and
//	remembers the answer (.forge/ports-dev.json) so it is stable from then
//	on.
//
// "Stable from then on" was true on exactly two code paths — `forge env up`
// and `forge env deploy`, the only callers that armed the store. Every other
// render (env config, env render, db reset's DSN reconciliation, status,
// doctor, build) ran with an unbound resolver and re-probed from scratch.
//
// That is worse than never persisting, because a re-probe's answer depends on
// whether the stack is UP. A running postgres answers on its port, so the
// availability probe calls it busy, so the render steps to the next port —
// forge walks off the very database it was asked to describe. The observed
// consequence: `forge env config dev` printed a DSN on one port while the
// stack was live on another, and `forge db reset` was handed a port nothing
// listens on, making it unreachable through the declared path.
//
// The tests below pin the claim itself: a recorded port is returned again,
// EVEN WHEN SOMETHING IS LISTENING ON IT, because "this port is busy" and
// "this port is busy because it is mine and it is running" are the same
// observation to a probe, and the store is the only thing that can tell them
// apart.
