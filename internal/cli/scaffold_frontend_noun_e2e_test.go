// TestE2EAddFrontendKindsProduceABuildableTree is the `forge scaffold
// frontend` counterpart to TestE2EAddVerbsProduceABuildableTree: it adds one
// frontend of EVERY kind to an existing project and then drives each through
// the toolchain that actually resolves modules.
//
// The existing frontend e2e (TestE2EScaffoldFrontendBuilds) covers `project
// new --frontend web`, which runs a full `forge generate` on its way out. The
// ADD verb does not — deliberately, so a parallel-agent round can stage a
// frontend without project-wide codegen churn — and that is where two shipped
// bugs lived:
//
//  1. The scaffolded src/lib/connect.ts references "@/lib/mock-transport",
//     which only `forge generate` emitted. A freshly added vite-spa failed
//     `tsc` outright (TS2307), and a freshly added Next.js frontend
//     typechecked but failed `next build` ("Module not found: Can't resolve
//     '@/lib/mock-transport'") — webpack resolves the literal require() that
//     tsc types as `any`. Hence BOTH checks below for the Next.js kind.
//  2. The Expo scaffold never declared expo-asset. npm nests it under
//     expo/node_modules, but @expo/metro-config resolves it from the project
//     root and hard-throws, so every scaffolded Expo app failed to bundle:
//     "The required package `expo-asset` cannot be found". Only a real bundle
//     surfaces that — the package is never imported by any source file, so
//     neither tsc nor an import-graph check can see it.
//
// COST: minutes. Three `npm install`s (one per added frontend, run by the add
// verb itself), a Next.js production build, and a full Metro bundle. It is
// `-tags e2e` like every other test in this family, so it is off by default
// and runs in the e2e CI lane. The cheap always-on guard for the same class is
// TestFrontendScaffoldImportsResolve (internal/generator), which resolves
// every import in every scaffolded kind in milliseconds — it catches bug 1 but
// structurally cannot catch bug 2.
