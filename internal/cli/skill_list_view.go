// The grouped default view for `forge skill list`.
//
// The flat table this replaces printed one row per skill, each carrying its
// full frontmatter description — 84 lines and several hundred columns wide for
// the shipped catalog. The measured cost was an agent reading it TWICE (head,
// then tail) to see the whole thing, spending on the INDEX the context it
// wanted for the skills.
//
// The redesign answers the question a reader actually arrives with — "which
// three do I load now, and what exists for later" — with three moves:
//
//  1. START HERE, above everything. The entry skill and the greenfield
//     walkthrough are not one row among sixty-three; they are the rows that
//     make the other sixty-three legible, and alphabetical order buried them
//     between `dev` and `interactor`.
//  2. Two catalog sections, split by AUDIENCE (skillMeta.Emit), because
//     "how does forge do X" and "how do I review code" are answers to
//     different questions and interleaving them makes the reader classify
//     all sixty-three by hand.
//  3. One row per GROUP, not per skill. Grouping is by name — both the path
//     children (`db/seeding`) and the hyphen siblings (`api-rest`), which are
//     children of `api` in everything except their path spelling. A group's
//     row carries a `+N` marker so the reader knows the sub-skills are there
//     to be asked for, without spending a row and a 200-character sentence on
//     each.
//
// Nothing is removed: `--all` still prints the exhaustive table, `--json` is
// byte-compatible for the sub-agents that parse it, and every collapsed
// sub-skill is still loadable by its exact path.

// startHereSkills is the short ordered list a reader loads BEFORE choosing
// from the rest of the catalog: the entry skill (which carries the whole
// greenfield walkthrough) and the map of where code goes. They lead the
// default listing and are excluded from the alphabetical body, so the head
// section is never a duplicate of a row further down.
var startHereSkills = []string{entryPointSkillPath, "architecture"}

// descWidth is the column budget for a description in the grouped view. The
// listing is an index, not the content: a reader picks from a short label and
// gets the full sentence when they load the skill.

//     three near-identical descriptions is precisely the noise the grouped
