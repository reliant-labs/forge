// Package cli — `forge start`: the greenfield brief, in one call.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A measured dogfood run spent six documentation calls
// (`forge --help`, `forge project --help`, `forge skill --help`,
// `forge skill list`, `forge skill load forge`, `forge project new --help`,
// `forge project annotations`,
// `forge skill load proto`) before authoring its first proto. Every one of
// those surfaces is correct and none is hidden; the cost is that reaching
// the four facts an agent actually needs first — how to lay out the
// project, how an entity is marked, that custom rpcs are never injected,
// and how a FK diamond is declared — takes one invocation per surface.
//
// Concatenating those sources is not an option: measured together they run
// past the consumer's 24 KB output ceiling, so the tail (the pointers
// onward) would be cut. This command is therefore a CURATION — the
// pre-first-proto subset, and nothing else.
//
// NOTHING HERE IS TRANSCRIBED. A second hand-written copy of the greenfield
// prose would drift from the skill that owns it, so every section is
// composed at run time from the source that already owns it:
//
//   - the sequence, the three authoring rules and the shape          the
//     embedded skills/forge/SKILL.md, extracted by heading. A retitled or
//     deleted heading is a hard error, never a silent omission.
//   - the `project new` flags     looked up on the real cobra command, so a
//     renamed flag fails loudly instead of advertising one that is gone.
//   - the proto→column vocabulary  scaffold.ProtoSQLMappings(), the same
//     iteration `forge project annotations` publishes.
//   - the entity markers          markerSpecs(), whose names come from the
//     registries the proto scanner spells its markers from.
//
// The deliberate omissions are everything an agent does not need before its
// first proto: the scaffold tree, the component catalog, deploy, ports,
// project kinds, and the skill catalog itself. Each is named, not inlined.

Load only when you reach the topic. ` + "`forge skill load <name>`" + ` prints the copy
this binary ships, which is authoritative over any copy on disk.

| Load | When |
|---|---|
| ` + "`forge`" + ` | the entry skill in full: the scaffold noun catalog, running the stack, the pre-flight checklist |
| ` + "`proto`" + ` | the full proto ruleset: field numbering, ` + "`optional`" + ` on list filters, one service per file |
| ` + "`db`" + ` | migrations, evolving a schema, queries the generated CRUD cannot express |
| ` + "`db/seeding`" + ` | FK diamonds in depth, and ` + "`forge db seed`" + ` |
| ` + "`api`" + ` | writing a custom rpc's body on the handler ` + "`*Service`" + ` |
| ` + "`services`" + ` | adding a service after ` + "`project new`" + `, and the other scaffold nouns |
| ` + "`architecture`" + ` | where logic goes, and the composition root |
| ` + "`frontend/design`" + ` | before showing any scaffolded UI to a user — it asks for a brief first |
| ` + "`testing`" + ` | the test harness and the generated per-rpc test rows |
| ` + "`forge-libraries`" + ` | before writing any utility — adopt from ` + "`forge/pkg`" + ` rather than port |

Three dumps answer "what does forge already do?" without prose:

    forge project capabilities   every verb, lint analyzer and marker
    forge project annotations    the full entity-authoring spec
    forge project libraries      every forge/pkg package; add a name for its full API

` + "`forge skill list`" + ` is the whole catalog; ` + "`forge skill search <keyword>`" + ` finds one
by topic.

## Rules

- Draft the proto, run ` + "`forge scaffold`" + `, read the error, fix. Never reverse-engineer forge's ` + "`internal/**`" + ` for syntax.
- Never hand-edit ` + "`gen/`" + ` or any ` + "`*_gen.go`" + `. Fix the proto or the migration and regenerate.
- Declare schema in migrations, never in proto.
- Run ` + "`forge lint && go build ./...`" + ` before calling a phase done.
