// `forge test` was removed. This file is the signpost that replaced it.
//
// The command is hidden (absent from `forge --help`) and runs NO tests — it
// exists only so the old spelling produces the replacement instead of cobra's
// bare `unknown command "test"` plus a usage dump. Every forge-owned caller
// (the generated CI workflow, the reliant one-shot gate, the shipped skills)
// was moved to `task test` in the same change, so nothing reaches this path on
// the golden loop; it is here for muscle memory and for out-of-tree scripts.
//
// Why the removal: a project's test suite is defined in its own Taskfile.yml,
// which is Tier-2 (scaffolded once, user-owned, never regenerated). Any project
// that customised it — extra tags, gotestsum, testcontainers, coverage
// thresholds — got a `forge test` that reported on a DIFFERENT suite than the
// one the project actually runs. That is worse than having no command: it is a
// green exit code for work that was never done. `forge lint` is not in the same
// position and stays: it orchestrates analyzers (contract, scaffold-boundary,
// optional-deps-guard) that exist only inside forge and have no standalone
// binary a Taskfile line could call.
//
// Delete this file once the spelling has stopped showing up in the wild.
