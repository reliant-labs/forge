// printing only "held by another process" therefore sent the reader to `lsof
// -i :<port>` to rediscover a fact forge had in hand one line earlier, at the
// exact moment `forge env up` had just failed. These tests pin the pid (and
// the command line when argv is readable) into the message, and pin the
// degradation path: an unreadable argv must still name the pid rather than
// suppress the holder line or trail a dangling separator.

// readiness gate can fail on: one held by a foreign process, one bound by
// nobody. Only the foreign one has a holder to report.
