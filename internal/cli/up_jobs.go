// The HOST lowering of the one-shot `job` component kind.
//
// k8s and compose each have a native way to say "run this to completion,
// then start that": an init container, and a `depends_on` with
// `condition: service_completed_successfully`. The host runner has
// neither, because there is no orchestrator underneath it — it is a
// process launcher. So the ordering the other two targets DELEGATE, this
// one has to ENFORCE: run the argv, wait for exit 0, and only then let
// the gated services launch.
//
// That asymmetry is the whole reason `Job` is a primitive rather than a
// k8s feature with a compose shim. The declaration is identical across
// the three; only the enforcement mechanism differs.

// defaultJobTimeout bounds the wait for a host one-shot that declares no
// spec.activeDeadlineSeconds (see jobDeadline).
//
// A one-shot that never exits is indistinguishable, from the outside,
// from one that is merely slow — and the failure mode of guessing wrong
// in the permissive direction is `forge env up` hanging forever with no
// output, which is the worst possible signal. Five minutes is far longer
// than any provisioning step should take and short enough that a wedged
// job is noticed within one coffee.

// BeforeAll is the BROADCAST selector for a one-shot's `before`: "gate
// every workload in this environment", as opposed to an enumerated list
// of dependent names. It mirrors `forge.workloads.BEFORE_ALL` in the KCL
// layer, which is where the value is defined and documented.
//
// A workload can never be NAMED this — a workload name is used verbatim
// as a Kubernetes object name and "*" is not a legal DNS-1123 label — so
// the wildcard cannot collide with a real dependent.
