// Ownership markers stamped onto every host process / frontend `forge env up`
// spawns (see stampForgeOwnership). They ride the child's environment, so
// they PROPAGATE to every descendant — air's re-exec'd server, npm's
// next/vite grandchild — regardless of pid churn or a stale/absent ledger.
// This makes process ownership a property of the LIVE process, discoverable
// by inspecting whoever actually holds a wanted port, rather than a fact
// that lives only in the drift-prone per-env .pids file.
//
// Ownership is keyed on the PAIR (project, env), never env alone. FORGE_UP_ENV
// names the environment; FORGE_UP_PROJECT names the specific project directory
// whose `forge env up` spawned the process. A reclaim (the pre-flight guard /
// `env down`) only ever touches a process whose BOTH markers match the
// reclaiming project+env, so two different projects sharing an env name (e.g.
// both "dev") can never kill each other's host processes — the incident. A
// process that carries FORGE_UP_ENV but NO FORGE_UP_PROJECT (a stack spawned by
// a pre-fix forge, or any non-forge process) can never match and is always
// treated as FOREIGN — the reclaim only ever NARROWS what counts as "ours".
