// Package cli — the machine-local record of which stacks `forge env up` /
// `forge run` started, and the teardown that acts on it.
//
// Three files are written per (project, env), under
// $HOME/.cache/forge/up/<project-id>/:
//
//	project.json     the project DIRECTORY <project-id> hashes from
//	<env>.pids       what this run started: "<name>\t<pid>" per line
//	<env>.env.json   the resolved discovery facts (live ports + DATABASE_URL)
//
// The <project-id> segment (see projectIDForDir) is what scopes every record to
// ONE checkout, so two projects bringing up the same env name never read each
// other's. Until project.json it was also ALL that was recorded — and a hash
// cannot be inverted. A stack whose project directory had since been deleted
// was therefore unreachable by every forge verb: `forge env down` derives the
// id from the forge.yaml above the working directory, and there was no
// forge.yaml left to derive it from. Eight rounds of the dogfood loop ended
// that way, leaving 38 orphaned processes, 7.5 GB resident and 15 listening
// ports that nothing could name. Recording the path is what makes that set
// enumerable (`forge env ps`) and stoppable (`forge env down --all`).
//
// These files are a RECORD, never an authority. Teardown proves ownership from
// the LIVE process markers (up_reclaim.go) and signals nothing else: a ledger
// drifts — a crashed run never persisted one, air re-execs under a new pid, and
// a pid the OS has since recycled belongs to a stranger — so "this file
// remembers pid 4242" is not proof that pid 4242 is ours to kill.
