	cmd := &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "upgrade [--force <path>...]",
		Short: "Update frozen project files from latest Forge templates",
		Long: `Detect template drift on frozen files (files written at 'forge project new' time but
not updated by 'forge generate') and apply updates from newer Forge templates.

Files that haven't been modified by the user are updated automatically.
User-modified files show a diff and are skipped unless --force is used.

--force is per-path. Naming paths after --force restricts the overwrite to
exactly those files, so you can adopt one new template without stomping every
other file you have customized. Bare --force keeps its whole-project meaning.

A file you have deliberately taken over is better claimed than defended:
'forge project disown <path> --reason ...' records the ownership transfer, and
upgrade then skips the file permanently — even under --force.

Scaffold-once files (each frontend's shared mechanism modules under src/lib and
src/hooks, plus the .github starters) get their own section and are NEVER written
implicitly. They are yours from birth; upgrade only reports what their templates
gained, how far behind you are in lines, and how many lines in your copy no
template accounts for. Adopt one by naming it:
'forge project upgrade --force <path>'. Bare --force does not reach them.

After a successful upgrade the project's forge_version field in forge.yaml
is bumped to the current binary version (or to --to when provided). Migrations
whose declared version range AND detection script both match this project are
surfaced first, so the LLM running upgrade can follow them step-by-step.

--check SUMMARIZES; --check <path> DETAILS. The report names each file that
differs and sizes the difference in lines — it does NOT print diffs inline,
because on a real project that is thousands of lines nobody reads. Files are
grouped and ranked by what adopting them costs: the ones with no local edits
come first, since for those a single --force is the whole job. Name a path
after --check to see that one file's full diff, or pass --all to list every
file the groups summarized.

Examples:
  forge project upgrade                        # Upgrade to latest, run all needed migrations
  forge project upgrade --to 1.5.0             # Upgrade to a specific target version
  forge project upgrade --dry-run              # Show what would change (alias for --check)
  forge project upgrade --check                # Dry-run summary: what differs, and by how much
  forge project upgrade --check buf.yaml       # That one file's full diff
  forge project upgrade --check --all          # Every reported file (still no inline diffs)
  forge project upgrade --force                # Apply all updates, even for user-modified files
  forge project upgrade --force buf.yaml       # Overwrite ONLY buf.yaml; leave other edits alone`,
