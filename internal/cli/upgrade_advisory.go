// being two lines behind, they buried the one row that was a trivial
// adopt. Grouping by cost puts the trivial adopts first and lets the
// expected divergence be a count with a pointer.

// MERGE, and forge is not the one who knows which of those lines matter.
// Saying so plainly is the difference between a report that respects the
// work in the file and one that reads as "you are out of date".
//
// No per-file migration-skill pointer is printed, because none would be
// true: nothing in skills/forge/migrations covers a frontend mechanism
// template today, and a pointer that is usually absent teaches readers to
// stop looking for it. When a template change IS too big to read off a
// diff, the place that says so is the migration catalogue this same
// command already surfaces — so the merge case names it.
// Both lists are ONE COMMAND PER LINE and capped. The adopt line used to
// name every adoptable path in a single --force — 34 of them on a real
// project, hundreds of characters wrapping across the terminal, adopting
// all 34 in one irreversible gesture. The merge sentence had the same
// defect: "37 file(s) carry lines no forge template has —" followed by 37
// inline paths. Both are per-line now; the paths that do not fit are one
