// `forge project upgrade --check <path>` — the detail half of the report.
//
// The summary (upgrade_report.go) deliberately prints no diffs: at 91
// reported files, inline diffs were 14,000 of the 14,244 lines emitted and
// were the reason the check went unread. Suppressing them is only honest
// if the diff is one command away, and this file is that command.
//
// It spans BOTH lanes on purpose. The user reading the summary sees one
// list of paths; making them know whether a path is a Tier-2 managed file
// or a scaffold-once advisory row before they can ask about it would leak
// forge's internal tiering into the one gesture that should be trivial.
// The lane still decides what the footer says, because the remedies really
// are different — that difference is information, the lookup is not.
