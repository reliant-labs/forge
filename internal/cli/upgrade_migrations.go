// Migration metadata + state lives alongside the existing template-drift
// upgrader (upgrade.go). The split is intentional: `forge project upgrade` (the
// existing command) runs deterministic codemods + template-drift rewrites;
// `forge project upgrade list` and `forge project upgrade apply <id>` surface the
// LLM-readable migration skills under skills/forge/migrations/ and let
// the user (or an agent) record that a migration has been applied.
//
// # The per-version model
//
// One skill per RELEASE that introduced a breaking change, named for that
// release and living at skills/forge/migrations/<version>/SKILL.md:
//
//	---
//	name: v0.5.0
//	description: the deploy target moved from forge.yaml into KCL
//	version:   v0.5.0
//	detection: grep -q '^dev_target:' forge.yaml
//	---
//
// `version` is the release that BROKE the shape, and it must equal the
// directory name — the directory is the identifier the CLI prints and
// records, the frontmatter makes the file self-describing when an agent
// reads it standalone, and TestMigrationSkills_VersionMatchesDirectory
// pins the two together so they cannot drift.
//
// A migration applies to a project when the project predates the release
// (baseline < version) AND the project still exhibits the old shape
// (detection exits 0). That pair is what makes a multi-version jump
// correct: a project pinned at v0.2 upgrading to v0.6 satisfies
// `baseline < version` for v0.3, v0.4, v0.5 and v0.6 alike, so it is
// handed all four in release order rather than only the last hop's.
//
// Why per-version rather than the per-transition ranges this used to
// use: a range ([from, to)) describes a project's position on a timeline,
// so a project that jumped a range without landing inside it fell through
// the gap and got nothing. A single `version` describes the RELEASE, and
// "did you cross it" is a question every baseline can answer, including
// baselines that skipped ten releases at once.
//
// Detection is REQUIRED, and it must test for the old SHAPE, never for a
// version — the version half of the decision is already made by the
// `version` field. A project can sit below a release and still not need
// its migration (it never used the feature that changed), and an
// unpinned or dev-built project has no usable baseline at all, so what
// the tree actually contains is the only gate that answers both cases.

// migrationSkillsRoot is the embedded-template path prefix where every
// migration skill lives. Every direct subdirectory of this root is a
// migration named for the release it belongs to; nothing else lives here.
const migrationSkillsRoot = "migrations"

// migrationsStateFile is the on-disk record of applied migrations,
// relative to the project root. The file is JSON; absent file means
// no migrations have been recorded yet.
const migrationsStateFile = ".forge/migrations.json"

// supportedUpgradeWindowMinors is how many minor releases back forge
// accepts as an upgrade starting point — the Istio model, where the
// project owner does a STAGED upgrade through intermediate releases
// instead of one long jump.
//
// The tradeoff this number sets:
//
//   - Larger N means fewer stops for someone upgrading an old project,
//     paid for by every migration skill in the window having to stay
//     correct against every shape in it. Migrations compose
//     multiplicatively — N releases back is N migrations that must all
//     still apply cleanly, in order, to a tree none of their authors
//     ever saw — and that product is what makes an unbounded registry
//     rot silently rather than loudly.
//   - Smaller N means a bounded, testable registry, paid for by more
//     intermediate hops on a very old project.
//
// Two is the smallest N that still lets someone skip a release they
// never deployed, which is the case that actually comes up. It is also
// the number the deprecation policy already promises: an old shape stays
// buildable with warnings for two minors, so a project inside the window
// is a project whose shapes forge still supports.
//
// This constant is also the pruning rule. When a release ages out of the
// window its migration skill is DELETED, not archived — a skill nothing
// can reach is a skill nothing tests, and the honest answer for a project
// that far back is the staged-upgrade message, not a stale playbook.
