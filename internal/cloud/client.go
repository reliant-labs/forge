// Client calls a hosted control plane over Connect's HTTP+JSON binding:
// POST <base>/<package>.<Service>/<Method> with a JSON body and a JSON
// reply.
//
// WHY HTTP+JSON AND NOT A GENERATED CLIENT. A generated client would
// mean vendoring the control plane's protos into forge, which is the one
// coupling that must not ship — it would make forge's deploy story
// specific to our control plane in exactly the way forge's External
// target is deliberately NOT specific to Fly.io. Connect's JSON binding
// is a documented, stable part of the protocol and needs nothing but
// net/http, so the wire contract stays a contract rather than a shared
// build dependency.
//
// The cost is real and worth naming: forge does not get compile-time
// checking of request and response shapes against the server's protos. A
// server-side field rename surfaces as a missing value at runtime rather
// than a build failure. That is the accepted trade for independence, and
// it is why Call decodes into explicitly-declared local structs — the
// shape forge expects is written down in one place instead of inferred.
