// Package cloud resolves the two things forge needs to talk to a hosted
// control plane, and keeps them apart on purpose:
//
//   - the ENDPOINT, which is a per-environment fact declared in that
//     environment's KCL (forge.ControlPlane) and lives in git.
//   - the CREDENTIAL, which is an opaque bearer string that must never
//     live in git, resolved at call time from a flag, an environment
//     variable, the shared credentials file `forge login` writes
//     (forge/pkg/credentials) keyed by THAT endpoint, or a credential helper
//     the host application names (forge/pkg/cloudcred).
//
// This split mirrors internal/secrets: KCL emits the DECLARATION, Go
// resolves the VALUE. It is also why there is no `forge context use`.
// A stateful "current endpoint" would make the answer to "which server
// did that command hit" depend on machine-local state that never appears
// in a diff; deriving it from the env argument makes the answer a
// property of the repository instead.
//
// Nothing here imports control-plane or reliant, and nothing may. The
// endpoint is an arbitrary URL and the credential an opaque string — the
// same relationship forge's External deploy target has with flyctl, which
// needs FLY_API_TOKEN without forge linking Fly's SDK.
//

//     that holds the user's session (Reliant sets it), minting a short-lived
//     token for ep on demand
//
// WHY THIS ORDER. It runs most-explicit to most-ambient. A flag is typed
// for one command and can mean nothing else, so it must win — that is
// what makes a one-off override possible at all, and what makes a bug
// report reproducible ("run it with --token X"). The env var comes next
// because CI is where it is used: a pipeline has no browser and no
// persistent home directory, so the variable IS its credential, and it
// must beat any file that happens to exist in a cached runner image. The
// file comes before the helper because a human who ran `forge login` chose
// that credential for that endpoint deliberately, and a host application
// signed in as somebody else must not displace it. The helper is last
// because it is the most ambient of all: it is simply "whoever this machine
// is signed in to the host as" — the right DEFAULT, and the wrong override.
//
// An EXPIRED `forge login` is not a dead end when a helper is configured:
// the user is still signed in to the host, so resolution falls through to it
// rather than demanding a second login. Without a helper it is reported as
// expired, because then `forge login` really is the fix.
//
// The file lookup is keyed by the endpoint. A login to staging can never be
// presented to prod: a prod command finds no entry and says so, instead of
// sending staging's token to prod's server and failing with an
// indistinguishable 401. The helper is asked FOR ep, and refuses an endpoint
