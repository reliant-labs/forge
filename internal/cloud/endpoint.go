// DefaultEndpoint is Reliant's production control plane: the one a plain
// `go install`'d forge targets with no configuration.
//
// It is the Go copy of KCL's forge.RELIANT_CLOUD_ENDPOINT, which is what
// `forge.ControlPlane {}` resolves to. KCL owns the default for every env; this
// copy exists for the one command that runs with no env to render — `forge
// login` outside a project (or in one that declares no control plane).
// TestControlPlaneDefault_KCLMatchesGo renders the schema and fails if the two
// drift.
//
// It is the PUBLIC origin serving forge's whole hosted surface: the
// controlplane.v1.* RPCs and the CLI OAuth endpoints (/oauth/authorize,
// /oauth/token). reliant's API host is a different server and answers 404 for
// both, so pointing this at it would break login for every user.

// Endpoint is one environment's resolved hosted control plane: where to
// send requests, and which env var holds the credential.
//
// There is deliberately no package-level "current endpoint" and no way
// to set one. An Endpoint only ever comes from a specific environment's
// declaration, which is what makes two environments resolvable to two
// different endpoints in the same process — and what removes the class
// of bug where a command silently targets whatever was selected last.

//
// Declared HERE, at the consumer, rather than importing the CLI's entity
// type: this package needs four strings, and taking a dependency on the
// renderer's struct would point the dependency the wrong way (cli
// depends on cloud, not the reverse) and drag the whole entity graph in
// behind it.

// ResolveEndpoint turns one environment's declaration into an Endpoint.
//
// decl == nil means the environment declares no hosted control plane.
// That is the overwhelmingly common case, so it returns a plain error
// naming the exact file to edit rather than falling back to
// DefaultEndpoint. An env that declares nothing is not hosted; defaulting
// here would mean a project with no hosted anything could send a request
// somewhere by accident, which is the one outcome this signature is shaped
// to prevent. The Reliant-cloud default belongs to the DECLARATION
// (`forge.ControlPlane {}` fills endpoint in KCL), never to its absence.
