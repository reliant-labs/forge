// ReasonHeader is the Connect error-metadata key under which a control plane
// delivers a stable, machine-readable domain reason code. It matches forge's
// own server-side convention (pkg/svcerr.ReasonHeader), and the value is an
// app-defined snake_case code such as "promotion_conflict".
//
// Declared here rather than imported from pkg/svcerr on purpose: this is the
// CLIENT half of the contract, and it must not acquire a dependency on
// forge's server library to read one header name. HTTP header keys are
// case-insensitive, so the canonicalization does not matter.

// Error is a failed control-plane call, as a TYPE rather than a sentence.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Call used to flatten every failure into a formatted
// string, and callers then recovered the classification by searching that
// string — `strings.Contains(err.Error(), "already_exists")`. That is wrong
// in both directions. A server that improves its prose breaks forge's
// control flow, which is a silent break: the branch simply stops matching
// and the error falls through to a generic failure. And forge's OWN message
// text contains the words it searches for, so a message that merely mentions
// a code reads as that code.
//
// Worse, the structured half was discarded entirely. A promote refusal
// carries a DeployPromoteRefusal detail naming the promotion that actually
// landed — exactly what a pipeline needs to print instead of "someone else
// moved prod" — and flattening to a string threw it away.
//
// So every primitive maps REASONS, not message text, to exit codes.

	// the one coupling forge's deploy story must not take on. Connect's
