// refuseForeignClusterDocs refuses a manifest stream that carries an object
// stamped for a DIFFERENT cluster than the kubectl context it is about to be
// written to.
//
// ClusterRoutingLabel is the render's statement of which context an object
// belongs on. A scoped apply honours it (ScopeManifestsToGroup drops every
// object stamped for another cluster), but an apply that reached kubectl
// UNSCOPED used to write the whole stream to the one context it was handed,
// whatever cluster each object named. That happened on 2026-10-09: a prod
// deploy whose entity read failed fell through to the env-wide direct apply,
// and every object stamped for prod's daemon cluster — a CNPG operator, its
// CRDs and webhooks, the kata pre-pull DaemonSet, a StorageClass, a
// RuntimeClass and RBAC — landed on the main cluster, where the operator
// crash-looped for a day.
//
// The label is the declaration, so a write that contradicts it is a routing
// bug upstream of this call, and the only safe answer is to write nothing and
// name what was misrouted. Every document is checked before anything is sent,
// so a refusal is never a partial apply.
//
// A document with no routing label (an env-shared object the render
// attributes to no cluster) and one that does not parse make no claim to
// contradict, so they pass. An empty kctx passes too: refusing a write with no
// context at all is KubectlApplyNamespaced's own check, and a dry run with no
// context writes nothing.
