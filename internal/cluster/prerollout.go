// The pre-rollout gate: one-shot Jobs that must COMPLETE before any workload
// in the same apply is touched.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ===============
// Apply used to send the migrate Job and every Deployment in ONE server-side
// apply, then wait for the rollouts, and only then for the Job. So the new
// code rolled out first and the schema moved second. A control-plane prod
// deploy log shows it plainly — `deployment.apps/admin-server
// serverside-applied` … `job.batch/control-plane-migrate-…
// serverside-applied` → `Waiting for rollouts...` → `…migrate…: complete`,
// about two minutes later — and for those two minutes every new pod served
// requests against a schema it did not have. A migration that FAILED was
// worse: the workloads had already moved, and the verdict arrived after the
// damage.
//
// Helm (`helm.sh/hook: pre-upgrade`) and Argo CD (`argocd.argoproj.io/hook:
// PreSync`) both answer this the same way: an explicit phase that runs, and
// must succeed, before the release's workloads change. This is forge's.
//
// THE MARKER
// ==========
// A one-shot Job declares its phase with the DeployPhaseAnnotation on its
// metadata. forge's KCL emits it from the declarative
// `forge.CronJob.deploy_phase` (and `forge.workloads.Workload.deploy_phase`),
// so a project states intent in KCL, and Go reads it from the stream it is
// about to apply — the one source that also sees a raw `kind: Job` a project
// placed in `additional_manifests`.
//
// It lives on the Job's metadata, NOT its pod template: the Job's name
// carries a hash of the pod spec, and declaring a phase must not rename (and
// therefore re-run) a Job that already completed.
//
// THE DEFAULT IS PRE-ROLLOUT, and an absent annotation means the same thing.
// The two ways to get it wrong are not symmetric:
//
//   - A Job wrongly held as pre-rollout fails LOUD and SAFE. The deploy
//     aborts before any workload changes, the previous release keeps
//     serving, and the error names the Job and the command that shows why.
//   - A Job wrongly let through as post-rollout fails SILENT and UNSAFE. New
//     code serves against the old schema, which is the incident above.
//
// The dominant deploy-time one-shot is a migration or backfill, whose whole
// purpose is to precede the code that needs it. The exception — a Job that
// needs THIS release's workloads to be serving (a provisioner that configures
// an in-stream identity provider) — declares `deploy_phase = "post-rollout"`
// in one line.
//
// SCOPE
// =====
// The gate orders ONE Apply, which is one cluster group's stream. Platform
// dependencies (helm-rendered charts) are applied before it, deliberately:
// they are the substrate a migration may itself need. A workload the Job
// depends on must not ride the same stream as a pre-rollout Job — the gate
// holds it back, the Job cannot reach it, and the deploy aborts naming the
// Job. That abort is the correct outcome; the fix is to declare the Job
// post-rollout or to move the dependency out of the release's own stream.
//
// The gate holds in every rollout mode. `--rollout=skip` means "do not wait
// for the cluster to converge"; it never meant "ship code ahead of its
// migration", and `--rollout=warn` tolerates a half-rolled cluster only
// because the previous Deployment is still serving — which is exactly what
// aborting at the gate preserves.

// DeployPhaseAnnotation is the Job metadata annotation that places a one-shot
// Job relative to the workloads in the same apply.
const DeployPhaseAnnotation = "forge.dev/deploy-phase"

	// DeployPhasePreRollout is applied, and required to COMPLETE, before any
	// workload in the same apply is applied. The default.

// pre-rollout Job has completed: everything that runs the release's code.
