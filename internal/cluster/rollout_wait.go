// The rollout WAIT, separated from the apply so that a deploy spanning several
// clusters can apply all of them before it waits on any.
//
// WHY THE WAIT IS SEPARABLE. One env may span several clusters, and a workload
// on one can be unable to become ready until a workload on another is running:
// control-plane's workspace-proxy-bridge cannot pass readiness until
// workspace-proxy, on the daemon cluster, answers it. Applying and awaiting
// each cluster in turn deadlocks that env on every fresh deploy — the first
// cluster's wait expires on a dependency the second cluster has not been sent
// yet, the deploy fails, and the second cluster is never applied at all.
// Kubernetes converges concurrently (RolloutPolicy.Order is documented as a
// wait ordering, not an apply ordering, for exactly this reason), so the
// deploy applies every cluster with ApplyNoWait and then hands every
// PendingRollout to ONE WaitRollouts.
//
// A single-cluster Apply is ApplyNoWait + WaitRollouts of that one pending
// rollout, and its output and error are exactly what they always were.

// PendingRollout is one apply's outstanding rollout: everything the wait needs
// to know about what that apply sent, and where. ApplyNoWait produces it and
// WaitRollouts consumes it; there is nothing to construct by hand.
