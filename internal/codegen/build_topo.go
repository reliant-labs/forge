// File: internal/codegen/build_topo.go
//
// Type-topological ordering over component Deps structs — the reusable
// core of the owned composition-root model (FORGE_SHAPE_REDESIGN §2).
//
// The owned internal/app/build.go is a typed composition root: it must
// construct each registered component via its New(Deps) AFTER every
// collaborator that component depends on by TYPE has been constructed.
// "By TYPE, not by name" is the whole point — billing.Deps.Users typed
// user.Service means construct user before billing, regardless of the
// field's name. This file computes that order.
//
// Conventional deps (Logger / Config / Authorizer / DB / Repo) come from
// the shared Infra value, never another component, so they NEVER
// participate in a topo edge. Only a Deps field whose declared type
// resolves to another registered component's Service interface produces
// an edge consumer -> producer.
//
// Cycle handling is deliberately LOUD (spec: "detect a cycle and emit a
// clearly-commented post-construction setter stub the user completes — do
// NOT silently break"). Kahn's algorithm yields the order; any nodes that
// never reach in-degree zero are a residual cycle, reported with the
// back-edges so build.go can emit a `// forge:build-twophase` block and
// `forge map`/`audit` can flag it as a guardrail finding.
//
// This is PURE over its inputs (the parsed component set + a type
// resolver) so it is unit-testable without a real project on disk.
