// The CHECK expression is a SERIALIZATION FORMAT that forge both writes and
// reads, and until this test nothing held the two ends together.
//
// FieldConstraints.SQLChecks is the sole WRITER: one protovalidate rule set
// projects to a `CHECK (...)` in the born migration. But three subsystems READ
// those same expressions back, each with its own hand-rolled regexes:
// seeddata's LengthBounds / BoundsFromTables / PoolsFromTables (so synthesized
// rows satisfy the constraints) and schemadrift (so a changed proto is
// detected). A reader can silently stop matching the writer and NOTHING fails
// — the seed just produces rows the DB rejects, or drift goes unnoticed.
//
// That is not hypothetical. seeddata's LengthBounds had a declared-varchar
// branch that had NEVER matched a live schema: it keyed off DeclType, which is
// rebuilt from udt_name and spells both `varchar` and `varchar(4)` as
// "VARCHAR". It shipped, and the bug only surfaced when `forge db seed` began
// hard-aborting on CHECKs forge itself had emitted.
//
// The existing pg tests do not close this: they apply HAND-WRITTEN DDL that
// approximates forge's output, so a change to the emitter's spelling leaves
// them green. This test generates the DDL FROM THE EMITTER, applies it to a
// REAL postgres, introspects it back through the production path
// (schemadef.ApplyAndIntrospect, which reads pg_get_constraintdef), and
// asserts each reader recovers the constraint the emitter was given.
//
// That round trip is the only thing that can catch the two failure modes that
// matter, because postgres CANONICALIZES what it is given — `CHECK (n >= 0)`
// comes back as `CHECK ((n >= 0))`, and on a varchar column `char_length(c)`
// comes back as `char_length((c)::text)`. A reader tested only against the
// emitter's literal output never sees the form it will actually meet.

// checkRoundTripCase is one constraint shape the emitter can produce, paired
// with what each reader must recover from it after a real postgres round trip.
