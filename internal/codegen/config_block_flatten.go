// Composed config blocks in the KCL projection.
//
// A config block is its own namespace in proto: `StaticSiteConfig.base_domain`
// and `SimpleBackendConfig.base_domain` are two different fields, bound to two
// different env vars, and the Go loader resolves each through its own message.
// Nothing about declaring both is a proto error.
//
// The KCL projection used to FLATTEN every block's leaves into the one
// `schema AppConfig` ("nested schemas are not yet projected"), so two blocks
// declaring the same leaf name arrived as two declarations of one field. The
// first mitigation qualified contested names (`simple_backend_base_domain`),
// which meant the key an operator typed in config.k depended on whether some
// OTHER block happened to declare the same leaf — adding a field to one block
// could rename a field in another.
//
// Blocks are now projected as NESTED schemas, which is what they are:
//
//	schema AppConfigStripe:            # one schema per composed block
//	    secret_key: ConfigSecretRef = …
//	schema AppConfig:
//	    stripe: AppConfigStripe = AppConfigStripe {}
//
// and config.k authors a leaf by its path, `stripe.secret_key = …` (KCL merges
// a path key into the nested schema's defaults). The namespace the proto has is
// the namespace KCL has, so no leaf name can collide across blocks and none is
// ever renamed. The flattener's job is only to hand the emitters one ordered
// field list in which every block leaf carries its KCLBlock.

// FlattenBlockLeaves projects rootMessage's fields into the field list the KCL
// emitters consume: its own scalar leaves, plus one level of the leaves of
// every config block it composes, each tagged with the block it belongs to
// (ConfigField.KCLBlock). Names are never rewritten.
