// TestDevSecretStoreCarriesNoDSN pins the invariant that replaced the
// seeded-DSN scheme: the dev secret store carries NO connection string.
//
// The dev postgres port is ONE fact, and the env's KCL is where it is
// stated: `deploy/kcl/dev/main.k` resolves it with
// `plugin.resolve_port("<project>-dev-postgres", 5432)` and composes
// DATABASE_URL from that variable, on every render.
//
// The store, by contrast, is written ONCE (write-if-absent, at scaffold
// time) and never revisited. Seeding a full DSN into it therefore created a
// SECOND copy of the port that could not track the first: resolve_port steps
// to 5433 when 5432 is busy, and the stored string stays on 5432 forever.
// Host-launch precedence hid the divergence (hostlaunch.LayerHostEnv layers
// KCL env vars ABOVE the secret store, so the declaration won), which made
// the stale copy inert rather than harmless — it is read by anyone opening
// the file, and by shadowdb's candidate scan.
//
// The seed also protected nothing. The scaffolded dev DSN's credentials are
// `postgres:postgres` on loopback, and the git-tracked main.k already spells
// them out in the same string. An empty slot leaves the port single-source
// and costs nothing: the KCL declaration supplies the value.
