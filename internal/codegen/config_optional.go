// Optionality rules for config fields.
//
// Forge has two ways to say a field may be absent and one to say it must be
// present, and the interesting case is the SENSITIVE field — because for
// those, "absent" is checked long before the process starts.
//
// A sensitive field projects to a secret_ref, and `forge env up` / `forge env
// deploy` validate every declared ref against the environment's store before
// anything runs (secrets.ValidateDeclaredRefs). That pre-flight is the point:
// the alternative is discovering a missing production credential at runtime,
// from a stack trace, which is exactly what it was built to prevent.
//
// So a declared secret with no value is an ERROR BY DEFAULT — and `optional:
// true` is the single, explicit way for an author to say the absence is
// intended. It is opt-in rather than inferred: forge cannot tell a credential
// nobody has configured YET from one this environment deliberately leaves
// unset, and guessing wrong in the permissive direction turns the check off
// precisely where it matters.

// ContradictoryOptionality names one field that claims to be both required
// and optional.
type ContradictoryOptionality struct {
	Message string // config message declaring the field
	Field   string // proto field name
	EnvVar  string // the field's env_var, when it declares one
}

// ValidateConfigOptionality refuses a field annotated `required: true` AND
// `optional: true`.
//
// The two are direct contradictions — one says startup fails without a value,
// the other says absence is fine — and forge refuses rather than picking a
// winner. Either precedence would be a silent behaviour that an author has to
// learn from source: resolving toward `required` makes `optional` decorative
// on the field that most needs it to work, and resolving toward `optional`
// silently disables a check someone asked for. A proto author who writes both
// has not decided yet, and the fix is one line either way.
//
// It reports EVERY offender rather than the first, for the reason
// ValidateFrontendConfigs does: these arrive in batches when a config block is
// split or copied, and fixing them one generate-run at a time is miserable.
