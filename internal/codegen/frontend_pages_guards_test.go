// guardedInvoiceService is the shape the `forge:guards` marker exists for,
// reduced to its smallest honest form.
//
// The service has the CRUD quintet for Invoice AND a custom RecordPayment
// RPC that enforces a state machine: it refuses an overpayment, and it is
// the only thing allowed to move invoices.amount_paid_cents. The scaffolded
// edit page reasons from the ENTITY's column list and knows nothing about
// that, so without the marker it writes amount_paid_cents raw through
// UpdateInvoice — bypassing the guard and tripping the raw
// invoices_not_overpaid CHECK as a 500.
//
// Note what the marker has to carry and why inference cannot: RecordPayment's
// request names `invoice_id` and `amount_cents`, and the column it guards
// (`amount_paid_cents`) appears in that request NOWHERE. Meanwhile
// `amount_cents` — the field name a matcher WOULD latch onto — is a real,
// freely-editable column on the invoice. Name-matching would miss the guard
// and wrongly freeze the total, both silently.
