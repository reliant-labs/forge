// One projection from a proto scalar kind to the TypeScript type
// protobuf-es declares for it — and the literals and conversions that
// projection implies.
//
// This is not forge's choice to make, exactly as ProtoTypeToGoType is not:
// the generated `_pb.ts` module already declares the field, and every
// frontend projection that disagrees with it emits TypeScript the
// project's own `tsc --noEmit` gate rejects — in files whose own header
// tells the author not to edit them.
//
// Before this table the frontend emitters answered the question three
// separate times: the mock TYPE switch (protoTypeToTSType), the mock
// VALUE switch (mockGenerateValue), and the form projection's
// bigint/numeric/repeated-numeric triplet. Every copy fell through to
// `string` for a kind it did not name, and the three disagreed with each
// other about which kinds those were. What that cost, measured on a
// virgin scaffold carrying one field of every kind:
//
//   - `bytes` mocked as a quoted string into a Uint8Array field (ten
//     rows × one error) and formed as `z.string()` fed straight into a
//     Uint8Array request field;
//   - `repeated bytes` mocked as string[] and formed as string[];
//   - `repeated bool` formed as string[] against boolean[];
//   - `repeated int64/uint64/sint64/fixed64/sfixed64` formed as
//     number[] against bigint[], because "repeated numeric" was a
//     two-way split (number or nothing) over a five-way truth.
//
// Nothing had ever put all fifteen kinds through the frontend path, so
// none of it was visible until an app declared a `bytes` column.

// protoScalarTS is the CLOSED proto scalar vocabulary — protobuf defines
// exactly these fifteen kinds — mapped to the TypeScript type
// protobuf-es v2 generates for a field of that kind.
//
// The 64-bit integers are `bigint` because that is protobuf-es's default
// jstype for them. A project can override the jstype to JS_STRING /
// JS_NORMAL in the proto; forge carries no signal for that today, and an
// override surfaces as a compile error naming the field rather than as
// silently wrong data.
