// Package codegen — geninput.go defines GenContext, the shared
// project-scoped context that every emitter needs (where the project
// lives, its module path, and the checksum tracker that keeps Tier-1
// output recorded in .forge/hashes.json).
//
// Historically the core emitters threaded ProjectDir / ModulePath /
// *checksums.FileChecksums through 7-12 positional parameters each.
// Newer emitters (mcp_gen, ingress_k3d_gen, deploy_config_gen) adopted
// a per-emitter GenInput struct instead. GenContext finishes that
// migration: GenInput structs EMBED it so the three fields are declared
// once and accessed uniformly (in.ProjectDir, in.ModulePath,
// in.Checksums) via Go's field promotion, while the per-emitter struct
// adds only the fields that emitter actually varies on.
//
// why embed rather than a *GenContext field: promotion keeps every
// existing `in.ProjectDir` / `in.Checksums` reference inside an emitter
// compiling unchanged, so converting an emitter to the struct form is a
// signature change at the call site only — the body is untouched.
