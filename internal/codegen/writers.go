// Two writer tiers, made legible.
//
// Generated output splits into two ownership tiers, and the tier dictates the
// write mechanism:
//
//   - forge-owned: files forge stamps and re-stamps on every `forge generate`
//     (wire_gen.go, bootstrap.go, *_gen.go, the rendered CI/deploy configs).
//     These go through checksums.WriteGeneratedFile so the checksum ledger can
//     later tell "stale codegen forge may overwrite" apart from "a user edit
//     forge must preserve". Always forced here (force=true) — the generate
//     pipeline owns these paths.
//
//   - user-scaffold: one-time starting points forge writes once and then
//     leaves to the user (service.go, the per-RPC rpc_<name>.go, the local
//     k3d ingress override, etc.). These are raw os.WriteFile — deliberately
//     NOT checksum-tracked, because forge is not the steward of their later
//     contents.
//
// The distinction used to be implicit in the choice of call (WriteGeneratedFile
// vs os.WriteFile). These thin wrappers name the intent at each call site
// without changing which files are checksummed.

// writeForgeOwned writes a forge-owned, checksum-tracked file via the checksum
// ledger (force=true — the generate pipeline owns this path).

// writeUserScaffold writes a one-time user-scaffold file. Deliberately not
// checksum-tracked: forge writes it once and leaves later edits to the user.
//
// It IS rollback-journaled (RecordPreWriteAbs): when a `forge generate`
// run fails after writes and rewinds the tree, the scaffold files written
// this run must rewind with it — a shim that survives while the Tier-1
// file it delegates to is reverted leaves a tree that compiles against
// neither the pre-run nor the post-run world. Journaling never converts
// the file to forge stewardship: on the SUCCESS path the journal is
// dropped and later user edits remain invisible to forge.

// canonicalizeUserGo runs a user-scaffold .go write through the same canonical
// formatter the pipeline's `goimports -local <module>` pass and the scaffolded
// .golangci.yml agree on, so the bytes forge leaves behind are already a fixed
// point of the project's own formatter.
//
// WHY THE WRITE CHOKEPOINT AND NOT THE CALL SITES. Several of these writes are
// TEXT INJECTIONS into a file forge does not own the rest of: ensureDepsDBField
// splices `DB orm.Context` into the user's Deps struct, injectValidateDepsDBCheck
// splices a check into validateDeps, the import fixups splice a line before a
// closing paren. An injector cannot know the alignment of a struct whose other
// fields it did not write — `"\tDB         orm.Context\n"` was padded by hand for
// one field set and shipped misaligned Go the moment the field set differed. So
// alignment is DERIVED here, once, for every injector at once, instead of being
// authored at each site and getting it wrong at each site independently.
//
// Best-effort by the same discipline as the forge-owned writer: a path that is
// not Go, or content that does not parse, is written verbatim. A template
// emitting broken Go should fail at the pipeline's `go build ./...` step with a
// real compiler error, not be silently swallowed at the write.

// internal/app/lifecycle.go, and the per-worker/operator subcommands): once
// scaffolded, the file is owned code the user hand-maintains (adding a component
