// derive_fill.go — field-level section defaulting.
//
// Section defaulting used to be all-or-nothing: `if sectionIsZero(c.Database)
// { c.Database = d.Database }`. Writing ANY key inside a section therefore
// suppressed the default for every OTHER key in it, and the fields left empty
// were not neutral — they fed feature derivation.
//
// The measured cost: forge's own migration-safety error recommends
//
//	database:
//	    migration_safety:
//	        allowed_destructive: [db/migrations/0009_harden.up.sql]
//
// as its escape hatch. That block makes the section non-zero, so Driver stays
// "", DeriveFeatureDefaults reads hasDB off it and resolves FeatureMigrations
// to false, and `forge lint --migration-safety` answers "migrations feature is
// disabled in forge.yaml" and exits 0. Following forge's own instructions
// silently switched off the safety check the instructions were about, and a CI
// job running that lint would go green with nothing checked.
//
// The fill is driven by WHICH YAML KEYS THE USER WROTE, not by whether the
// decoded field is zero. That distinction is the whole design: a zero-value
// test cannot tell `race: false` from an absent `race`, so it would resurrect
// every explicitly-disabled boolean whose default is true — trading a silent
// disable for a silent ENABLE, which is the same class of bug pointed the
// other way. Presence comes from the yaml.Node tree, which knows exactly.
//
// ApplyDerivedDefaults (no node in hand — tests, post-load mutation) keeps the
// whole-section semantics, which is correct for its callers: they are filling
// a config nobody hand-wrote.
