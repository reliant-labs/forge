// frontend_inventory.go — the frontend inventory, derived.
//
// There is no `frontends:` key in forge.yaml. The inventory is the frontends
// found under frontends/ on disk, overlaid by the KCL `forge.Frontend`
// declarations (MergeFrontendInventory). It is a CODEGEN INVENTORY: the set of frontends forge projects
// generated TypeScript into (Connect hooks, config_gen.ts, mocks, CRUD
// pages). It is not a deployment topology — a deploy declares its
// frontends in deploy/kcl/<env>/main.k, and a project may legitimately
// deploy a frontend forge does not generate a single byte for.
//
// Conflating the two is the bug this file closes, in both directions:
//
//   - A project that moved its frontend topology into KCL and deleted the
//     `frontends:` block lost its codegen inventory with it. `forge
//     generate` then emitted nothing for a frontend whose code is right
//     there in the repository, and reported its ~30 already-generated
//     files as stale — including config_gen.ts, so the app kept declaring
//     a config field the proto no longer had.
//
//   - `forge doctor`'s drift check read cfg.Frontends as though it were
//     the deploy inventory and reported every KCL-declared frontend
//     missing from it, including ones forge must never generate into.

// KCLFrontend is the narrow view of a KCL-declared frontend this package
// needs to fold one into the inventory. internal/config is a pure schema
// package with no internal imports, so callers (internal/cli's
// FrontendEntity, internal/doctor's renderedFrontend) convert into it at
// their own boundary rather than making this package depend on theirs.

// The load seam is the whole point. This resolution used to happen in a

//	src/lib/basepath_gen.ts  createBasePath(env ?? "")       (forge-owned, EMPTY)
//
// An undeclared prefix therefore did not fail — it produced a HALF-PREFIXED
// app. Next served routes and assets under the prefix from its own config,
// while forge's joinBasePath() became a no-op, so every hand-built URL lost
// the prefix. The casualty is the runtime config document: a scaffolded
// layout writes <script src={joinBasePath("/config.js")}>, which rendered as
// "/config.js" and 404'd against a file living at "/internal/config.js".
// window.__FORGE_CONFIG__ then never existed, every runtime value silently
// fell back to its schema default, and the app called whatever API origin
// that default happened to name.
//
// Measured on control-plane's operator console: the deployed frontend dialed
// the API's DEV origin and every request died on CORS — which reads as a
// backend CORS misconfiguration and is actually this. The generated helper
// and the generated next.config disagreeing about the same value is a defect
// forge can see and must not emit.
//
// # Why next.config.ts is the right source
//
// Because it is where the value already IS. A project that declares its
// frontends in KCL rather than forge.yaml (a deploy-topology-first layout,
// which forge explicitly supports — see DiscoverInRepoFrontends) has no
// forge.yaml frontend entry to carry base_path, but its next.config.ts
// necessarily states the prefix or Next could not serve the app at all.
// Reading it back makes the two generated files agree by construction
// instead of by the user remembering to state the prefix twice.
//
// forge.yaml ALWAYS wins when it declares base_path: this runs only on the
// discovery path, which is by definition the case where forge.yaml said
