// LoadProject is THE forge.yaml loader: it parses a forge.yaml byte stream
// into a ProjectConfig with strict validation, derives the project kind from
// the project's real sources, and applies the shape-derived section defaults.
// Both the CLI loader and the generator's ReadProjectConfig route through it,
// so the load rules live in exactly one place.
//
// Unknown keys (typos, dropped fields) and missing required fields are
// reported in a single error rather than silently succeeding or failing on
// the first issue.
//
// path locates the project on disk: its directory is read to derive the
// project kind, and it prefixes error messages. It is never opened for the
// config bytes themselves — the caller supplies those. A path with no
// on-disk project behind it (byte-only loads) loads as a library.
//
// Behaviour:
//
//  1. The YAML is decoded into a yaml.Node tree, then walked against
//     the ProjectConfig struct shape. Unknown keys are collected with
//     their YAML line number and parent path; a Levenshtein-based
//     suggestion is attached when a known sibling key is within edit
//     distance 2 (or 3 for keys >= 8 chars).
//  2. The same bytes are then decoded into a ProjectConfig via the
//     standard yaml decoder so that scalar-type mismatches (e.g.
//     port: "8080") surface as their own error class.
//  3. Required-field validation runs on the populated struct.
//
// All issues across the three phases are batched into a single
// ValidationError; the caller sees the full list rather than just the
// first failure.
//
// What a project CONTAINS is not part of this: components are read from the
// code that declares them (codegen.DiscoverProjectComponents), never from
// forge.yaml and never from a field on the returned config.
