// File: internal/contractcheck/deps_are_interfaces.go
//
// The forgeconv-deps-are-interfaces rule fails ANY package that
// declares a `Deps` struct field whose type is a concrete struct
// pointer (or a concrete struct value) rather than an interface.
//
// Why this exists, and why it is not gated on a marker
//
// A component earns its unit tests precisely because every dep is
// behind an interface: `New(Deps{...})` takes mocks, the test
// exercises the real subject, and nothing real is dragged in.
// `Deps: *db.PostgresRepository` defeats that — the test has to
// construct a real repository (or fork-and-mock the whole concrete
// type), so it stops being a unit test and starts needing a database.
//
// That property has nothing to do with what ROLE a package plays. It
// follows from `Deps` existing at all. The rule was once gated on a
// per-package role marker, and the gate is why it covered zero
// packages in forge's own tree and zero in control-plane — while
// control-plane carried 28 concrete-typed `Deps` fields, nine of them
// exactly `*db.PostgresRepository`. An opt-in rule is not a rule; it
// now applies wherever a `type Deps struct` exists.
//
// Detection
//
// 1. Scan internal/<pkg>/ for `type Deps struct { ... }`.
// 2. For each field, classify the type:
//      *T            (pointer to anything other than `interface{...}`) → fire
//      pkg.T         (selector type) → resolve it; interface → ok, else fire
//      stdlib.T      (any type from the standard library)              → ok
//      []T, map[K]T  → primitive element/key → ok, else fire
//      func(...) ...  (any signature)                                   → ok
//      interface{}, named interfaces                                    → ok
//      Logger / Config singletons by field name                         → ok
//      a struct whose every method is a pure field accessor (DATA)      → ok
// 3. The `*slog.Logger`-style logger is the one allowed concrete
//    pointer (loggers are pre-configured singletons; mocking is rare
//    and hand-rolled). We allow it by matching the field name
//    `Logger` rather than the type, which is loose but pragmatic.
//
// Resolution is not optional, and that is why this is an ERROR
//
// A `pkg.T` selector is resolved for real — in THIS module by walking
// the source tree, in any other module by asking `go list` where that
// import path lives and parsing it there. Both answer one question: is
// T declared `type T interface`?
//
// That completeness is what earns error severity. The rule used to
// resolve same-module selectors only and assume every third-party
// `pkg.T` was concrete, "absorbing the false positives at warning
// severity". Measured on control-plane, that assumption produced 9 false
// findings out of 28 — `jetstream.JetStream` (7), `client.Client` and
// `audit.Store` — every one of which is declared an interface by the
// package that ships it. A rule that is wrong a third of the time cannot
// be promoted, and a rule nobody can promote is a rule authors scroll
// past; the two facts are the same fact. Resolving across module
// boundaries removes the class, and with it the hardcoded allow-list of
// forge's own interface types that existed to paper over the single most
// common instance (`orm.Context`, which forge's own CRUD generator
// writes into the Deps of every service it wires).
//
// Severity is error. The remaining findings are the real foot-gun —
// `Deps: *db.PostgresRepository`, a concrete type YOU own — and the fix
// is mechanical: declare a narrow interface at the consumer. It gates
// `forge lint`, NOT `forge generate`: preCodegenContractCheck runs the
// contract-NAMES rule alone, because that is the one whose violation
// makes generated code fail to compile. A concrete dep compiles fine; it
// just cannot be unit-tested, which is a lint verdict.

// concreteTypeIsData reports whether expr names a type — through an

//
// # Why purity and not a method count
//
// The question this rule actually needs answered is not "how many methods"
// but "is there anything here a test would have to fake". A struct parsed
// out of YAML that grows two convenience accessors over its OWN fields is
// still data: an interface over `StorageSizeForTier(string) string` asserts
// nothing and mocks nothing, and the remedy the finding prescribes produces
// a wrapper around a map index. Conversely a type with ONE method that
// opens a connection is a collaborator whatever it is named, and a count
// threshold would wave it through.
//
// The predecessor of this function tested for zero methods, and named
// control-plane's `*config.WorkspaceConfig` in its own comment as the case
// it existed to cover. That config then grew two tier-lookup accessors and
// the exemption stopped covering the case it was written for — which is the
// evidence that a count was never the distinction.
//
// So: T is data when it embeds nothing (an embedded field promotes a whole
// foreign method set that no declaration in this package can see) and EVERY
// method it declares is a pure value accessor — accessor-shaped in its
// signature (methodSignatureIsAccessorShaped) and, unless the type's fields
// are provably inert, pure in its body (methodBodyIsPure). A zero-method
// struct satisfies that vacuously, so the case the old test covered is
// still covered.
//
// # What the syntactic test CANNOT see, and which way it errs
//
// It has no type information. It cannot tell that `c.Store.Get(k)` reads a
// map rather than a database, so it sees a call and refuses. It cannot
// follow a call into a helper to prove the helper is pure, so it refuses
// there too. Both answer "collaborator" for something that may be data,
// and that is the SAFE direction: the author sees a finding on a config
// struct — the status quo before this exemption existed — rather than a
// repository slipping past the rule.
//
// The unsafe direction, vouching for a real collaborator, requires a type
// whose every method reads its own fields and calls nothing at all. That is
// the definition of data, so there is no shape to spoof: a repository
// cannot escape by being named `Settings`, by declaring few methods, or by
// living in a package called `config`.

// field holds, and no syntax distinguishes a map from a database. It is
// wrong for a package-level func, because that call reaches exactly one
// declaration and it is right there to be read.
//
// Measured on control-plane: `*config.WorkspaceConfig` is a
// YAML-deserialized bag of storage defaults whose accessors index its own
// maps — the exact case the exemption's own comment names. It fired anyway,
// solely because one accessor called a package-level tier helper, and
// INLINING that helper made the finding disappear. A rule whose verdict
// flips on whether a pure expression was given a name is not measuring
// anything about the type.
//
// # Why it is not a hole
//
// The helper's body gets the SAME walk as a method body — no I/O, no
// goroutines, no channels, no package-level vars, and every call it makes
// recursively judged the same way. A helper that reaches a database fails
// that walk exactly as an inlined copy of it would, so naming a statement
// cannot launder it. Three further guards:
//
//   - A function whose body is unavailable (assembly, //go:linkname, or a
//     package that did not parse) is impure: the default remains "cannot
//     see means collaborator".
//   - Recursion is answered impure via funcPurityVisiting rather than
//     recursed into. A cycle is not a shape a config accessor has.
