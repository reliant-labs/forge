// File: internal/contractcheck/internal_pkg_contract.go
//
// The forgeconv-internal-package-contract-names rule asserts that every
// internal-package contract.go declares the shape the injector wires:
//
//   - a contract interface — `Service`, or any name carrying
//     `//forge:service` / `//forge:contract`
//   - `type Deps struct { ... }`
//   - a constructor `func(Deps) <Contract>` or `func(Deps) (<Contract>, error)`
//     — `New`, or any name carrying `// forge:constructor`
//
// The injector (internal/codegen/inject_gen.go) emits
// `<pkg>.<Constructor>(<pkg>.Deps{...})` and types the field off the
// contract interface, resolving BOTH names through the same detectors this
// rule uses (codegen.DetectServiceInterfaceName, codegen.IsComponentConstructor
// / codegen.DetectConstructorName). Lint and codegen therefore cannot
// disagree: whatever this rule accepts, generate can wire.
//
// The names are free because forcing them is an antipattern — `Service` and
// `New` are poor names for a mailer or a store, and forge is meant to promote
// good practice, not conscript packages into bad naming. What is NOT free is
// the signature: a constructor that doesn't take `Deps` and return the
// contract has nothing for the injector to bind, so `forge generate` would
// write a compile-broken internal/app/compose.go pointing the user at
// generated code they don't own. This rule surfaces that before generate runs.
//
// The two-result form `(Service, error)` was introduced in Day-5 polish
// alongside `validateDeps()` so the bootstrap can surface required-Deps
// gaps once at startup instead of forcing per-RPC nil-checks. The
// scaffold templates emit the two-result form for new packages; the
// single-result form remains accepted so pre-Day-5 packages continue to
// pass lint until they're refactored.
//
// Migrated from internal/linter/forgeconv/internal_pkg_contract.go on
// 2026-06-04 as part of collapsing forge's three contract-check entry
// points onto a shared engine. The detection logic is byte-for-byte
// preserved; only the surrounding API (export name → lowercase, return
// type uses forgeconv.Result) changed.

// internalPackageDirs walks rootDir/internal/ once and returns every
// package directory the two canonical-shape rules consider, split by
// whether it declares a contract.go. The split is the ONLY difference
// between the two rules' inputs: everything else — the testdata/ skip, the
// forge.yaml `contracts.exclude` list, the per-package
// `//forge:exclude-contract` directive — is applied here, so a package can
// never be in scope for one rule and out of scope for the other. Both
// slices are sorted, so findings come out in deterministic order.
//
// The excludes argument carries module-relative directory paths (matching
// forge.yaml `contracts.exclude`) that the walk must skip wholesale: those
// packages are not bootstrap-managed (analyzer sub-packages, embed-only
// packages, the cli surface itself), and their contract.go files are
// allowed to declare alternate shapes.
//
// withoutContract is narrower than withContract in one further way, and the
// reason is the verb, not the shape. `forge scaffold package <name>` creates
// `internal/<name>/` and its name validator rejects "/", so an IMMEDIATE
// child of internal/ is precisely the set of directories that verb owns.
// Everything deeper belongs to another role — `internal/handlers/<svc>/`,
// `internal/workers/<pkg>/`, `internal/operators/<pkg>/` are components of
// their own kind, scaffolded by their own verbs, and they deliberately never
// carry a contract.go. Measured on control-plane, recursing produced five
// findings against `internal/handlers/<svc>/service.go` — forge telling the
// author to run `forge scaffold package` on a file `forge scaffold service`
// wrote. The day the package verb accepts a nested name, this widens with
// it. (withContract stays fully recursive: nested contract packages like
// "mcp/database" ARE discovered and wired by codegen, so the shape rule has
// to keep judging them.)
//
// A directory lands in withoutContract only if it actually holds Go source
// the shape scan can read — a parent directory that only holds
// subdirectories (internal/, internal/handlers/) is not a package.
//

// lintMissingContract is the complement of [lintInternalContracts]: that
// rule asks whether a contract.go declares the canonical shape, this one
// asks whether a package that HAS the shape declares a contract.go at all.
//
// The gap it closes is real and was measured. `forge scaffold package`
// writes contract.go, service.go, contract_test.go and mock_gen.go
// together; a component created with a raw file write instead has none of
// them, and every downstream mechanism keys on contract.go —
// codegen.DiscoverInternalPackages (bootstrap wiring), the mock walk, the
// observe decorator, `forge project map|graph|audit`. So the package is not
// half-wired, it is invisible: `forge lint` passed on a hand-written
// component in a dogfood run and named nothing.
//
// # What "looks like a component" means here
//
// internal/ legitimately holds packages that are not components —
// constants, domain errors, pure helpers, an interface plus the one type
// that implements it — and telling every one of them to run a scaffold verb
// is how a rule gets muted. So the trigger is not "has behaviour" or "has an
// interface". It is that the package is already speaking forge's contract
// VOCABULARY, resolved by the same detector codegen and the shape rule use:
//
//   - an interface named `Service`, or one carrying `//forge:service` /
//     `//forge:contract` (codegen.DetectServiceInterfaceName)
//   - `type Deps struct`
//
// Nobody writes `type Deps struct`, names an interface `Service`, or marks
// one `//forge:service` by accident. Each is an unambiguous claim to be the
// thing `forge scaffold package` produces — made without running it.
//
// The injector's constructor signature `func(Deps) <Contract>` is NOT a
// third disjunct, because in any package that compiles it implies a `Deps`
// type declaration and the second claim has already fired. A branch no
// realistic package can reach on its own is a branch no test can pin.
//
// [shouldSkipContractShapeCheck] is deliberately NOT the gate, and the
// measurement is why. Its interface-count early-outs are calibrated for a
// package that already declared itself a contract by WRITING a contract.go;
// applied to packages that never did, its residue is one shape —
// `ifaces=1, no Deps, no constructor` — and swept across four real trees
// (forge, control-plane, peptides-dogfood-r2, reliant) that shape produced
// 13 findings, every one of them an abstraction seam that correctly wants no
// contract: localfs.FS, validation.Collector, devautograntplan.PlanAssigner.
// The existing early-out's own comment gives the reason — the >= 2 threshold
// exists because "a single interface declaration is more likely an
// incomplete contract than a deliberate catalogue", and "incomplete
// contract" is exactly the reading that does not apply to a package with no
// contract.go. The vocabulary trigger above fires 1 time across those same
// 95 contract-less packages: reliant's internal/worktree, which declares
// `type Service interface`, `type service struct` and
// `NewService(...) (Service, error)` — a hand-built component, correctly
// named.
//
// The same sweep is why the packages from the dogfood run stay silent: both
// are constants-plus-pure-functions packages (domain reason codes and a
// ReasonError value type; a handful of stateless policy helpers). Neither
// speaks any of forge's contract vocabulary, and neither wanted a Service, a
// Deps or a mock.
//
// Severity is WARNING. The rule reasons about intent where the sibling shape
// rule reasons about a declaration the author already made; warning is also
// what deps-are-interfaces shipped as until its false-positive rate had been
// measured on real trees and it was promoted. The same bar applies here.
