// THE QUARANTINE
//
// One entry per finding that is real, unfixed, and owned by a surface outside
// this package. A quarantine entry is NOT an allowance: it does not say "this
// is fine", it says "this is a live defect, here is what it costs, and here is
// who must fix it". Two properties keep it from becoming a dumping ground:
//
//   - TestQuarantineIsTight fails when an entry no longer matches a finding.
//     Fixing a defect therefore FORCES the entry's deletion; the ledger can
//     only shrink.
//   - Every entry carries a Cost — the concrete thing that is wrong today.
//     "Known issue" is not a cost. If the cost cannot be stated, the entry is
//     not understood well enough to quarantine.
//
// Adding an entry to make a NEW finding green is the failure mode this whole
// package exists to prevent. Fix the code.
