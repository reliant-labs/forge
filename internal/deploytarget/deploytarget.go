// Package deploytarget owns the deploy dispatch — the surface that maps a
// rendered workload's RUNTIME (and each frontend's and database's deploy
// target) to a concrete pipeline that ships it somewhere.
//
// Placement is fully owned by KCL: every fw.Workload is bound to one runtime
// (forge.OnHost | OnCompose | OnCluster | OnHosted | BuildOnly), per workload,
// so one env can run some workloads on a cluster, some on the control plane
// and some as host processes. The CLI walks the rendered workloads, groups
// them by target (workloads that share a cluster/namespace or a compose file
// flow through one pipeline invocation), and dispatches to the right
// Provider.
//
// Providers:
//
//   - K8sClusterProvider — wraps internal/cluster.Apply (the render-KCL →
//     expand Workload records through pkg/deploy.RenderWorkloads →
//     kubectl-apply → wait-rollouts pipeline).
//   - HostedProvider     — publishes a Workload CR per hosted workload (plus
//     StaticSite / ManagedDatabase) to the control plane.
//   - ComposeProvider    — docker compose pull/up -d.
//   - HostInfraProvider  — a third-party server (postgres) run as a HOST
//     PROCESS, no container runtime. This is the DEFAULT shape for dev
//     infrastructure; Compose is the opt-in for projects that want the
//     container. See internal/hostinfra.
//   - FirebaseProvider / StaticSiteProvider — frontends.
//
// Host-bound and build-only workloads aren't providers — `forge run` /
// `forge env up` own the host story, and BuildOnly is consumed by `forge
// build`. The dispatcher skips both rather than routing them through a
// Provider.
//
// HostInfra IS a provider even though it also runs on the host, because it
// answers a different question: a host workload launches code this project
// BUILDS, HostInfra supervises a dependency forge FETCHES. They fail
// differently (a compile error vs. a missing binary vs. a held port), and a
// single "runs on the host" target would have to guess which it was
// looking at.
//
//forge:lint-disable-next-line forge-exclude-contract-outbound-io: each registered Provider is its own outbound adapter (kubectl, compose, oras for StaticSite, the hosted API); the registry dispatches, and a per-provider package split is CONTRACTS follow-up F2
//forge:exclude-contract: a deploy-provider strategy registry — every target registers itself with (*Registry).Register, and each Provider is its own adapter
