// HostInfraProvider brings up the dev infrastructure an environment
// declares as `forge.HostInfra` — a real server binary forge fetches and
// supervises as a HOST PROCESS, with no container runtime involved.
//
// It is a Provider like any other so that the thing which decides HOW dev
// infra runs is the environment's KCL, not a branch in forge's Go. An env
// that declares `forge.HostInfra {engine = "postgres", …}` gets a host
// postgres; one that declares `forge.Compose {service = "postgres"}` gets
// the container; and the code path that dispatches them is the same
// group-then-look-up-the-provider loop in both cases. Adding a mode meant
// adding a provider, which is the seam that already existed.
//
// See internal/hostinfra for the postgres implementation and for why the
// data directory persists while the server outlives the process that
// started it.
