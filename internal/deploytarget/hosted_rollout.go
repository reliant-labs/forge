// GetRollout: the control plane's ONE answer to "has this promotion landed"
// (control-plane docs/design/hosted-deploy-primitives.md §3.2, task F3).
//
// WHY A SECOND READ ALONGSIDE GetStatus. GetStatus answers "is this
// environment converged on what it CURRENTLY DECLARES", which is the right
// question for a drift badge and the wrong one for a deploy's completion
// check. The gap is not cosmetic:
//
//   - It is not pinned to a promotion. A promote of v7 landing while this
//     deploy waits on v6 moves the rows to v7, and the wait then "succeeds"
//     on bytes it was never asked about.
//   - A normal rollout reads DIVERGED mid-flight, so neither failing on
//     DIVERGED nor ignoring it is correct.
//   - Observation can claim the new digest before any new pod serves it:
//     under RollingUpdate the old ReplicaSet keeps readyReplicas up while
//     the new one crash-loops.
//
// The phase folds all three into one server-computed verdict, scoped to the
// promotion whose pins this deploy published. So `forge env deploy`,
// `forge env status --wait`, the in-flight promote refusal and the UI read ONE
// definition of done rather than four that drift apart.
//
// DEPLOY'S THRESHOLD IS DELIBERATELY NOT `env wait`'S. A deploy completes on
// SUCCEEDED **or STABILIZING** — "published and serving" — because making
// every deploy sit out the server's stability window would make every deploy
// two minutes slower for no new information. `forge env status --wait` is the verb
// that holds for the window, because a release GATE is asking the stronger
// question.
//
// The wire shapes are declared HERE rather than imported, for the reason
// stated at the top of hosted.go: forge does not vendor the control plane's
// protos, so what forge expects is written down in explicit local structs.
