// Observe — the third verb, and why it is a verb rather than a field on
// Deploy's result.
//
// Deploy and Rollback are IMPERATIVE and ONE-SHOT: they describe a
// transition ("ship this", "go back"), they run once, and when they
// return they have no further opinion. Neither answers the question a
// reconciler is built around — WHAT IS ACTUALLY RUNNING RIGHT NOW — and
// that gap is the whole difference between a deploy tool and a
// reconciler. A deploy's own return value cannot answer it either: it
// reports what forge ASKED for and whether the ask was accepted, which
// stops being true the moment anything else touches the target (a manual
// kubectl edit, a crash-looping pod, a CDN pointed at a pruned release).
//
// So Observe is a READ, with no side effects, that a caller may run at
// any time — including against a target forge has never deployed to.
//
// # Unknown is a first-class answer, and the zero value IS unknown
//
// Not every target can be read back. `External` runs an OPAQUE `sh -c`
// command — forge does not know whether that command talked to Fly.io,
// systemd or a wet string, so there is genuinely nothing to read. The
// honest report is "I do not know", and this package makes that the
// DEFAULT rather than something a provider must remember to say:
//
//   - [Health]'s zero value is [HealthUnknown]. A provider that forgets
//     to set health cannot accidentally report healthy.
//   - [ObservedItem.Replicas] is a POINTER, so nil means "this tier has
//     no replica concept" rather than "zero replicas are running" —
//     which for a static site is the difference between "not applicable"
//     and "the site is down".
//   - A provider that cannot observe at all returns
//     [ErrObservationUnsupported], AND still returns an Observed whose
//     items are explicitly unknown, so a caller that logs the value
//     without checking the error still cannot read green.
//
// That last point is deliberate belt-and-braces. Go convention says a
// value returned beside a non-nil error is unusable, and a careful caller
// will check. The reason to populate it anyway is that the failure mode
// of the careless caller here is not a crash, it is a REPORT OF HEALTH
// THAT NOBODY MEASURED — and claiming reconciliation you do not have is
// worse than admitting the gap.

// Health is a provider's verdict on one observed item. It is an int enum
// precisely so its ZERO VALUE is [HealthUnknown]: an Observed built by
// any path — a provider, a test literal, a future caller — reads as
// unknown until something deliberately says otherwise.
//
// Four values, and each is a genuinely different decision for a caller:
// "nothing is there" and "something is there and it is broken" call for
// opposite actions (create vs. investigate), so collapsing them into one
// "not healthy" would force every consumer to re-derive the distinction.
