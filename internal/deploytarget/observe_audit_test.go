// The observation AUDIT: every registered provider must either observe
// for real, or DECLARE that it cannot and say why.
//
// # Why this test exists rather than a per-provider test each
//
// Per-provider tests are already here and they are good at what they do:
// they pin each observer's verdicts against real wire shapes. What none
// of them can catch is the thing most likely to actually happen — a
// SEVENTH provider gets added, nobody writes an observer or a test for
// it, and every existing test still passes. The board reads clean for an
// environment forge measured part of, which is the precise failure the
// Observe verb was introduced to make impossible.
//
// So this test derives its subject list from the REGISTRY (Registry.IDs)
// rather than restating it. A provider that reaches NewRegistry reaches
// this test, with no second place to remember to update. That property is
// itself asserted below, because a "comprehensive" audit that silently
// enumerates nothing is worse than no audit at all.
//
// # What counts as passing
//
// Exactly two outcomes are acceptable for a provider, and BOTH are
// checked in full — a provider cannot pass by being half of each:
//
//  1. It observes. It returns no ErrObservationUnsupported, and it names
//     every service it was handed. (What the verdicts should be for given
//     inputs is the per-provider tests' job; this asserts only that the
//     provider engaged with the question at all.)
//  2. It declares. It returns ErrObservationUnsupported carrying a
//     non-empty, non-placeholder Reason, AND an Observed whose every item
//     reads HealthUnknown with a detail — so a caller that ignores the
//     error still cannot read green.
//
// A provider that returns a bare nil error and an EMPTY report — the
// natural shape of a stub someone added to satisfy the compiler — matches
// neither, and fails.

// auditSubject is one provider under audit, with a group shaped so the
// provider has something to speak about. The group matters: handing every
// provider an empty ServiceGroup would let each one return an empty
// report, which passes "no item is healthy" vacuously.
type auditSubject struct {

}

// auditGroupFor builds a populated group for a provider id.
//
// It returns ok=false for an id it does not know, and the test FAILS on
// that rather than skipping it. That is the enforcement mechanism: a new
// provider added to NewRegistry with no entry here fails the audit
// immediately, at which point the author must decide what a populated
// group for it looks like — which is the moment they also discover
// whether it can observe. Skipping unknown ids would turn this whole test
