// Observe reads each compose service's container state back out of the
// local docker daemon.
//
// # Why `compose ps --format json` and not the state file
//
// The deploy path writes a DeployState after a successful `up`, and
// reading it would be cheap, offline and wrong: it records what forge
// last DID, which stops being true the moment a container exits, is
// stopped by hand, or is recreated by another tool. That is precisely the
// gap this verb exists to close, so the observation asks the daemon.
//
// `--format json` rather than the table `compose ps` the deploy-time
// health check parses. The table's columns shift between compose
// versions and `composeHasRunningLine` only needs a yes/no, but an
// observation needs the running image, the state and the health
// separately — and recovering three fields by splitting a table whose
// column order is not a contract is how a parser silently starts
// reporting the wrong column. The JSON keys are stable.
//
// # Why the digest is usually empty, and why that is correct
//
// Compose reports the image REFERENCE the container was created from,
// which for the overwhelmingly common dev case is a mutable tag. A tag
// cannot answer "which bytes are running", so Digest stays empty unless
// the reference is digest-pinned — the same rule, and the same reasoning,
// as the cluster tier's digestFromImageRef.
//
// # Why no replica counts
//
// A compose service CAN be scaled, and compose reports one row per
// container, so the count is readable. It is deliberately not reported as
// ReplicaCounts: that struct's four fields are a rollout's vocabulary
// (updated-vs-ready is what distinguishes "rolled out" from "rolling
// out"), and compose has no rollout — there is no pod template generation
// to be current or stale with respect to. Filling Desired and Ready while
// leaving Updated and Available at zero would render as a permanently
// half-finished rollout. Container count goes in Detail, where it is
// information rather than a claim about a concept compose does not have.
