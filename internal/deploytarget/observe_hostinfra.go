// Observe reports whether each declared host-infra instance is currently
// serving, on which port, and which engine build.
//
// # Why the data directory and not the port
//
// A port probe is the obvious implementation and it is the wrong one on
// the machine this tier targets. A developer box runs several stacks;
// the declared port may be held by ANOTHER project's postgres or a
// system one, and reporting that as "our instance is up" would show green
// for a database this project has never written to. That is the same
// adoption mistake hostinfra.Start refuses to make, and an observation
// that made it would be worse than the deploy — it would be believed.
//
// So ownership is decided by the DATA DIRECTORY (hostinfra.StatusOf),
// and a port held by something else is reported as its own state rather
// than folded into either "up" or "down".
//
// # Why running is not healthy
//
// A live process is not a server that answers. Postgres writes its pid
// file and then spends its recovery phase refusing connections; the dev
// IdP is alive for the whole of its declarative bootstrap. Reporting
// either as healthy would tell a caller the thing it is about to dial
// will respond, which is exactly the claim that is false. Health is
// HealthHealthy only when the instance both runs AND answers.
//
// # Why Replicas is nil and Digest is empty
//
// Nil rather than &ReplicaCounts{Desired: 1}: a supervised host process
// has no replica concept at all, and this is the distinction the pointer
// exists to carry — "not applicable" versus "nothing is running". Digest
// stays empty because there is no content-addressed identity to report:
// forge fetches a released engine binary by version, and a version string
// is a mutable pointer in the same way an image tag is. The version goes
// in Detail, which is information rather than a claim about bytes.
