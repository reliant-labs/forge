// Observe reads each service's Deployment status out of the cluster.
//
// # Why the Deployment's status and not the pods
//
// A Deployment's status subresource is the cluster's OWN summary of a
// rollout: the controller maintains updatedReplicas / readyReplicas /
// availableReplicas against the current pod template. Listing pods and
// counting them would re-derive that summary, and re-derive it WRONGLY
// during a rollout — a pod from the previous ReplicaSet is ready, and
// counting it as ready would report a rollout complete while half of it
// is still the old version. updatedReplicas is the field that carries
// that distinction, and it exists only on the Deployment.
//
// # Why the digest comes from the pod template
//
// The image on `.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image` is what the
// Deployment is CURRENTLY ASKING FOR. An image pinned by digest
// (`repo@sha256:…`) yields a content-addressed identity a reconciler can
// compare against a release ledger; an image pinned by mutable tag yields
// nothing comparable, so Digest stays empty rather than carrying a tag a
// caller might mistake for an identity. That empty is not a failure —
// forge's own --no-digest path produces it deliberately — so it does not
// downgrade health on its own.
//
// # Context is declarative, exactly as it is for a write
//
// The kubectl context is group.Cluster, with NO fallback to the active
// context. Rollback refuses outright on an empty context because it is a
// mutation; a read cannot corrupt anything, but it CAN report another
// cluster's state as this environment's, which is a worse outcome than
// no answer. So an empty context reports unknown rather than reading
// whatever context happens to be selected.
