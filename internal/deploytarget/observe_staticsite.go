// Observe reports which release digest each frontend's live prefix is
// currently serving.
//
// # Why the recorded state, checked against the bucket
//
// A static site has no process to ask, so "what is running" is "what does
// the live prefix hold". The bucket cannot answer that directly: live/ is
// a SYNCED COPY of a release prefix, not a pointer at one, so listing it
// tells you the files and not which release they came from. The deploy
// path already records the answer (WriteDeployState after every deploy
// AND every rollback, which is what makes the recorded value track
// reality rather than only the last deploy), so the digest comes from
// there.
//
// A recorded value alone would be a CLAIM, not an observation — it says
// what forge did last, which stops being true the moment retention, a
// bucket lifecycle rule or a human `gcloud storage rm` removes the
// archive underneath it. So the recorded digest is CONFIRMED against the
// bucket's actual release listing, and a digest whose archive is gone
// reports degraded: live/ is still serving those bytes today, but the
// rollback target behind it has evaporated.
//
// That check is also the only thing here that costs a network call, and
// it is the reason this is an observation rather than a state-file read.
