// registryRel is the on-disk port-block registry: a stable {key: entry} map,
// resolved relative to the REPO ANCHOR (the primary checkout) so every linked
// worktree of a repo shares ONE registry — see repoAnchor in gitfacts.go.
// The block is the INTERNAL index forge multiplies by 100 to offset a
// stack's ports; it is never surfaced in KCL. The default key "" is
// implicitly block 0 and is NOT stored — only named keys consume registry
// slots, starting at 1, so the default stack's port block (base + 0*100 =
// base) is never displaced. Machine-local; .forge/* is gitignored.
const registryRel = ".forge/blocks.json"

// entry is one registry record: the port block, plus WHAT KIND of key it is.
//
// Why the kind matters. This registry serves two unrelated purposes that look
// identical once written down as a bare {key: int} map:
//
//  1. DEV-STACK IDENTITY — one key per active git worktree, the roster a
//     per-stack config generator enumerates to emit one config block per
//     running stack.
//  2. PLAIN PORT-BLOCK ALLOCATION — any KCL expression that just wants a
//     non-colliding host port, e.g. prod's reliant-web dev server keying on
//     "prod" so it does not land on dev's :3000.
//
// Conflating them is not hypothetical. control-plane's dev NATS generator
// enumerated the whole registry, assumed every key was a worktree, and
// rendered a `CP_prod` account with `user: "control-plane-prod"` — a dev NATS
// account for a PROD web port — into a TRACKED deploy/nats/nats.conf. That is
// the same file the "prod-" empty-interpolation fragment corrupted (see
// validateKey), and the same file the generate-path purity guard was built to
// revert (internal/cli/kcl_render_purity.go). Three defects, one root cause:
// forge offered no way to ask "which of these keys are actually dev stacks?",
// so enumerating the raw registry was the only move available — and it is
// wrong by construction.
//
// Stack is therefore recorded at ALLOCATION time, where the answer is known
// for certain, rather than guessed later by pattern-matching key names. A
// generator reads the roster through ListStacks / the fp.dev_stacks() builtin
// and never sees a port-block key at all.
// Origin closes the OTHER half of the same question, and it is the half that
// leaked. Stack answers "is this key ITSELF a worktree?"; Origin answers "was
// this key DERIVED FROM one?" — and a key can be the second without being the
// first. prod's web port keys on `"prod-" + option("worktree")`, so
// "prod-cp-obs" is every bit as tied to worktree cp-obs as a stack key is,
// while being a different string from it.
//
// Because only Stack was recorded, Prune saw "prod-cp-obs" as indistinguishable
// from "prod" — a standalone key tied to no worktree — and skipped it. Delete
// the worktree and the block is held forever. Observed in control-plane: three
// of eight blocks were stranded by dead worktrees, and since the ceiling counts
// BLOCKS, those three were enough to make `forge env render prod` impossible in
// any worktree.
//
// Origin is recorded at ALLOCATION time for the same reason Stack is: that is
// the one moment forge holds the git fact and the key TOGETHER, so the
// association is observed rather than guessed. Guessing it later — pattern-
// matching "prod-cp-obs" back to a worktree name — is precisely what this field
// exists to avoid, because a standalone key that merely LOOKS composed is
// indistinguishable from a real one once the fact is gone, and getting that
// wrong moves ports on a live stack.
//
// An empty Origin means "tied to no worktree" and is therefore NEVER
// reclaimable. That is the safe default, and it is what a legacy entry, a key
// allocated from the primary checkout, and a genuinely standalone key like
// "prod" all decode to.
type entry struct {
	Block int  `json:"block"`
	Stack bool `json:"stack,omitempty"`

	Origin string `json:"origin,omitempty"`

// originFor reports the worktree this key should be recorded as derived from,
// or "" for a key tied to no worktree.
//
// Two conditions must BOTH hold, and each rules out a different false positive:
//
//  1. A worktree is active. On the primary checkout (and on any unarmed
//     read-only render) there is no fact to attribute the key to, so nothing is
//     recorded. This is what keeps "prod" — allocated from the primary
//     checkout, where option("worktree") is "" — permanently unreclaimable.
//  2. The active worktree appears in the key as a whole dash-delimited SEGMENT.
//     A KCL author composes a derived key by interpolation, so a derived key
//     literally contains the fact; a key that does not contain it cannot have
//     been derived from it. Without this, a KCL that allocates a fixed shared
//     key would be attributed to whichever worktree happened to render first,
//     and deleting that worktree would move a port the other stacks still use.
//
// Segment matching rather than substring matching is what keeps the check from
// being a heuristic about names: "cp-obs" is a segment of "prod-cp-obs" but not
// of "prod-cp-observability", so a longer worktree name is never mistaken for a
// shorter one it happens to start with.

// reconcileOrigin updates an EXISTING entry's origin from what this allocation

// It moves in two directions, and they are not symmetric:
//
//   - LEARN. An entry with no origin gains one when the key is requested from a
//     worktree whose name is a segment of it. This is how entries written
//     before this field existed migrate: the next render from the key's own
//     worktree records what forge would have recorded then. It is evidence, not
//     inference — the fact and the key were held together at that moment.
//   - UNLEARN. An entry loses its origin when the SAME key is requested while a
//     DIFFERENT worktree is active. A derived key cannot be produced from
//     another worktree (worktree W composes "prod-W" and nothing else), so this
//     is proof the key is shared rather than derived, and the earlier
//     attribution was wrong.
//
// Only a NON-EMPTY active worktree counts as contrary evidence. An empty one is
// ambiguous — it means either the primary checkout or a render that never armed
// the git facts (forge generate, forge ci, tests) — and treating that ambiguity
// as proof would strip the origin off every derived key the first time an
// unarmed render touched it. The cost of being wrong here is asymmetric: losing
// an origin re-creates the leak this field fixes, while inventing one moves a
// live stack's ports. So every uncertain case resolves toward "leak", never
// toward "reclaim".

// Why the registry refuses rather than repairs. A KCL author composes a key

// half is empty the key that arrives is a trailing-dash FRAGMENT rather than
// a name. forge used to accept it and memoize it, at which point
// .forge/blocks.json held an entry indistinguishable from a real stack.
//
// Nothing failed there. It failed two steps downstream, in version control:
// control-plane's per-stack NATS generator enumerates this registry, and the
// "prod-" fragment rendered an account named CP_prod_ with
// `user: "control-plane-prod-"` into a TRACKED deploy/nats/nats.conf. So
// `forge generate` emitted different bytes on a machine that had once run
// `forge env up prod` than on a fresh clone, and CI's Verify Generated Code
// job failed for whoever's machine-local state differed.
//
// The malformed shape is only recognizable HERE. Once a generator reads the
// registry, "prod-" is just a string, and by then the port has been issued.
// Silently sanitizing it would be worse than rejecting: "prod-" and "prod"
// would collapse onto one block, so a key that had already been handed a port
// could move — and a moved port invalidates a k3d host mapping or an issuer's
// baked-in `iss` claim. Every key forge itself supplies (Worktree, Branch) is
// already canonical, so a non-canonical key can only come from a composed KCL
// expression, and naming it is what makes that expression findable.
//
// WHAT THIS CHECKS IS SHAPE, NOT LENGTH — and that distinction is the whole
// defect this function used to have. It compared the key against Sanitize,
// which does two unrelated jobs: it fixes SHAPE and it TRUNCATES at
// maxNameLen. So a perfectly well-formed key differed from its own sanitized
// form purely by being long, and was refused as "not canonical". Since prod's
// key is "prod-" + the worktree name, any worktree whose name exceeded 19
// characters could not render prod AT ALL — and `forge-deploy-882e308d`, at
// 21, is an utterly ordinary name of exactly the shape reliant's own tooling
// generates (~/.reliant/worktrees/<org>/<name>-<hash>).
//
// The message made it materially worse. It attributed the failure to an EMPTY
// INTERPOLATION and printed the `_wt = option("worktree") or ""` guard — which
// was already present and correct three lines above the failing call. The
// error therefore pointed AWAY from the cause, and following it literally led
// to nothing to change. The two conditions have unrelated fixes, so they now
// get separate branches and separate messages.
//
// WHY THE LONG KEY IS ACCEPTED RATHER THAN TRUNCATED OR HASHED. The choice is
// between three options, and it turns on what a port-block key actually IS:
//
//   - TRUNCATE to 24 (what the old message tantalizingly computed and printed
//     before refusing). Unsound, because truncation is not injective.
//     "prod-implement-billing-webhooks-a" and "prod-implement-billing-webhooks-b"
//     both cut to "prod-implement-billing-w", so two prod stacks would SILENTLY
//     share one port block and then fight over the same host ports with no
//     error anywhere. That is strictly worse than refusing: it converts a loud
//     failure into a silent one. Pinned by
//     TestLongKeysThatTruncateAlikeStayDistinct.
//   - HASH-SUFFIX (truncate to 24 with a discriminator appended). Sound on
//     collisions, but it buys that soundness by MANGLING the key, and the key
//     is the registry's primary key. A user reading .forge/blocks.json or
//     `forge env devstack list` would see a name they never typed, and the
//     mapping back to their KCL expression is gone. It also cannot be
//     introduced without moving already-issued blocks for any key that is
//     currently long — and a moved port invalidates a k3d host mapping and an
//     issuer's baked-in `iss` claim.
//   - ACCEPT THE KEY VERBATIM (chosen). Collisions become impossible rather
//     than merely detected, because distinct keys stay distinct strings, and
//     the registry keeps the exact name the KCL composed.
//
// The third is available because the 24-char budget was never this function's
// to enforce. maxNameLen budgets a git FACT that gets embedded as ONE SEGMENT
// of a longer composed name (a k8s namespace, a DB name, a NATS subject); it
// is applied once, in Worktree/Branch, where truncating is sound because the
// fact is not a unique identifier of anything. A port-block key is a map
// lookup that resolves to an integer offset — it is never itself a namespace
// or a DB name. The only key kind that reaches a name-shaped consumer is a
// STACK key (ListStacks), and that one is byte-equal to the already-bounded
// worktree fact by construction (see isStackKey), so it is bounded by the fact
// budget without this function doing anything.
//
// Verified against the actual consumers: dev's KCL keys on option("worktree")
// directly, which is Sanitize's own output and so already ≤ 24 and idempotent
// under the shape check — dev could never have tripped this, at any worktree
// name length. Only a COMPOSED key ("prod-" + fact) can exceed the fact
