// THE REGISTRY IS PER-REPO, NOT PER-DIRECTORY.
//
// A block is a claim against a MACHINE-WIDE resource: block N means "host
// ports base+N*100 on this machine", pre-mapped once in the cluster's port
// map and baked into the dev IdP's `iss` claim. A per-directory registry
// cannot express that claim, and it failed in both directions at once —
// which is what these tests lock.
//
// Observed (control-plane, 8 k3d-mapped stacks live on the machine):
// `forge env up dev` in a fresh linked worktree died with "this machine has
// already reached the 8-stack ceiling", while that worktree's own
// .forge/blocks.json did not exist and `forge env devstack list` printed
// nothing. The ceiling was counting an EMPTY registry. Had the ceiling been
// higher, the same emptiness would have handed this worktree block 1 — a
// block another running stack already holds — so the two stacks would have
// rendered identical host ports.

// TestRegistryIsSharedAcrossLinkedWorktrees is the core lock: a block
// allocated from one worktree must be VISIBLE from another worktree of the
// same repo, because they contend for the same machine-wide ports.
