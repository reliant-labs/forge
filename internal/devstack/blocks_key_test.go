// An empty KCL interpolation must not reach the block registry.
//
// Incident (control-plane, cutting v0.1.9): prod's KCL composes its port key
// as `"prod-" + (option("worktree") or "")`, meaning "prod-<worktree>". On the
// primary checkout the interpolation is empty, so the key forge was handed was
// the literal "prod-" — a trailing-dash fragment, not a name. forge accepted
// it and memoized it, and `.forge/blocks.json` gained a "prod-" entry that
// looked exactly like a registered stack.
//
// Nothing surfaced there. It surfaced two steps later, in a file under version
// control: a per-stack config generator enumerating the registry rendered an
// account named CP_prod_ with `user: "control-plane-prod-"` and
// `password: "control-plane-dev-nats-prod-"` into a TRACKED nats.conf, so
// `forge generate` produced different bytes on a machine that had once run
// `forge env up prod` than on one that had not.
//
// The empty-interpolation signature is visible right here, at the API
// boundary, and nowhere downstream: by the time a generator reads the registry
// the fragment is indistinguishable from a deliberate name. Every key forge
// itself supplies (Worktree, Branch) is already a canonical DNS-safe label, so
// a non-canonical key can only have come from a KCL expression that composed
// one — and rejecting it names the file and the fix while a silent repair
// would move an already-issued port.

// TestAllocateBlockRejectsEmptyInterpolationKey is the regression lock: the
// malformed key is refused, and — the part that actually caused the incident —
// it never lands in the registry that generators enumerate.
