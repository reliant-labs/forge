// A PRE-MAPPED PORT THAT ANSWERS IS NOT A TAKEN BLOCK.
//
// This is the defect that actually broke `forge env up` on a machine with a
// live k3d cluster, and it is worth stating precisely because the symptom
// pointed somewhere else entirely.
//
// The cluster pre-maps EVERY stack's host port at cluster-CREATE time — that
// is deliberate, and it is what lets a new worktree start without recreating
// the cluster (see control-plane's generated deploy/k3d-ports.yaml, "Covers
// all 8 parallel dev stacks"). The consequence is that all 8 ports answer a
// TCP dial from the moment the cluster exists, whether or not any stack is
// using them.
//
// AllocatePortAvoidingForeign then probed those ports to pick a block for a
// NAMED key, found every one of them answering, walked to block 8 and hit the
// ceiling. So forge reported "this machine has already reached the 8-stack
// ceiling" for the FIRST worktree on the machine, while the registry that the
// ceiling supposedly counted was empty and `forge env devstack list` printed
// nothing. The advice in the message (`prune`) could not help, because there
// was nothing stale to reclaim.
//
// The fix is a boundary, not a threshold: a NAMED key takes its block from the
// registry, deterministically. Probing is reserved for the default key "",
// which is the only case it was introduced for (two different PROJECTS on one
// machine both wanting block 0's base port).

// TestNamedKeyIgnoresPreMappedPorts is the regression lock for the reported
// failure. Every port in the block range answers, exactly as a live k3d
// cluster makes them, and the allocation must still succeed at block 1.

	// 8 pre-mapped stack ports 28080..28780, so they all answer. 28880 is
	// past the pre-map, so it is genuinely free — and that is the trap. The
	// probe walks the 8 answering ports, finds block 8 "free", and asks for a
