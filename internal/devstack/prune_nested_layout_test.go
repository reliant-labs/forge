// PRUNE OFFERED TO RECLAIM A RUNNING STACK'S BLOCK.
//
// Found by running the fixed `forge env devstack prune --dry-run` against a
// real machine: it reported it would reclaim "my-new-feature-50f77334" while
// that worktree was on disk with a stack running in it. That is the exact
// failure this command is built to never commit — reclaiming moves ports, which
// invalidates the k3d host-port mapping and the dev IdP's baked-in `iss` claim.
//
// Cause: two derivations of the same key that had drifted apart.
// liveWorktreeKeys built the live set with Sanitize(filepath.Base(root)), while
// the ALLOCATOR keys a stack on Worktree(), which additionally runs
// disambiguate(). In the nested-repo layout every worktree is <container>/<repo>:
//
//	~/.reliant/worktrees/reliant-labs/my-new-feature-50f77334/control-plane
//	~/.reliant/worktrees/reliant-labs/newtool-5709b18d/control-plane
//
// so every basename is "control-plane" and the live set collapsed to a single
// entry that matched no registry key at all. Every stack in that layout looked
// dead simultaneously.
//
// The fix derives the live set through Worktree() itself, so the two cannot
// drift again by construction rather than by two implementations agreeing.

// nestedWorktree creates <container>/<repo> under a fresh temp dir, the layout
// that makes every worktree root share one basename.
