// clusterhealth.go — the "Cluster Workloads" runtime check.
//
// forge applies manifests to a cluster and then held NO opinion about
// whether what it applied is alive. `forge env status <env>` reported Host
// services, Frontends, Compose Infra and App Health — every one of them a
// fact about the developer's own machine — and printed nothing at all about
// the cluster it had just deployed to. Two measurements from one week on
// control-plane, both invisible to forge at the time:
//
//   - `daemon-gateway` was OOMKilled and then CrashLoopBackOff for over an
//     hour while `forge env status dev` stayed all-green. The product
//     reported "no machine is connected" and no forge command would say
//     why. The decisive fact — `lastState.terminated.reason: OOMKilled` —
//     was reachable only by hand, with kubectl, by someone who already
//     suspected the answer.
//   - Later, `admin-api` sat in CreateContainerConfigError while two
//     `litellm` pods and two `reliant-api-server` pods crashlooped to ~120
//     and ~130 restarts each. That ran for TEN HOURS in the deployed
//     namespace with nothing in forge reporting it.
//
// The same hole exists at the gate: `forge env up` blocks only on HOST
// service readiness ("host service(s) never came up under this run") and
// exits 0 with cluster workloads crashlooping behind it.
//
// FOUR PROPERTIES MAKE THIS CHECK WORTH READING
//
//  1. It reports the facts that end the investigation, not a rollup. A pod
//     NAME, the container, the waiting reason, the restart count, and —
//     called out explicitly, because it was the decisive invisible fact —
//     `OOMKilled` from `lastState.terminated`. "1 workload unhealthy" would
//     have saved nobody an hour; "daemon-gateway-8598f99486-frs5m 0/1
//     CrashLoopBackOff last=OOMKilled(exit 137) restarts=37" ends it. The
//     detail therefore goes in the MESSAGE, not only in Evidence: Evidence
//     prints only under `-v`, and the person who needs this is not passing
//     `-v` yet — they do not know there is anything to look at.
//
//  2. It is scoped to the workloads THIS env renders, matched against the
//     rendered set. A namespace is not an environment: `dev` and `dev-k8s`
//     both render into `control-plane-dev`, and reporting on everything in
//     the namespace would make one env's status depend on another env's
//     leftovers. Cross-env writes are a different defect with its own check
//     (CheckObjectCollision); this one answers "is MY env alive".
//
//  3. It honours the three-state Status model, and that is the whole point.
//     A check that answers Pass when it could not look is precisely what
//     created this gap. Cluster unreachable, kubectl missing, context not in
//     the kubeconfig, RBAC refusing the list, render failed, a workload whose
//     cluster could not be determined → [StatusUnknown], which `forge env
//     status` prints as "N UNDETERMINED (not a pass — forge could not obtain
//     the facts)". Only "this env deploys nothing to Kubernetes" is
//     [StatusSkip]. An Unknown anywhere also SUPPRESSES a Pass verdict for
//     the rest: a partial look is not a clean bill of health.
//
//  4. It cannot hang. Every cluster call is bounded, the KCL render is
//     bounded, and a timeout reports Unknown. This runs inside `forge env
//     status`, a snapshot command a human waits on, whose whole runtime
//     phase has a 15s leash (internal/cli.envStatusCheckTimeout).
