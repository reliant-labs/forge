// clusterinventory.go — the STRUCTURED half of the "Cluster Workloads" check.
//
// The check (clusterhealth.go) already holds every fact a consumer could
// want: the rendered workload set, the cluster and namespace each one was
// read from, the pods that matched it, their phases and restart counts. It
// then threw all of it away, formatting the facts into a prose Evidence
// blob and a one-line Message meant for a human at a terminal.
//
// That made `forge env status <env> --json` actively misleading. Its only
// structured inventory was `services` — the HOST processes, a fact about
// the developer's own machine — so a consumer asking forge "what is running
// in prod?" received two local dev servers as data, while the fourteen real
// deployments existed only inside a string. The one documented path to them
// was to parse that string, which is the class of workaround this project
// forbids outright: the format is a display concern and every change to it
// silently breaks the parser.
//
// So the check now ALSO emits what it already knew. Nothing here re-queries
// a cluster; [buildInventory] is assembled from the same targetResults the
// Evidence is rendered from, which is what makes the two incapable of
// disagreeing.
//
// THE CERTAINTY DISCIPLINE CARRIES OVER, and it is the whole reason this is
// a document rather than a bare array. "forge looked and found no
// workloads" and "forge could not reach the cluster" are different facts,
// and an empty JSON array states the first while meaning the second. So:
//
//   - [ClusterInventory.Status] is the check's own verdict, in the check's
//     own vocabulary (pass / fail / warn / unknown / skip) — never a
//     parallel one invented for JSON.
//   - A cluster that refused to answer appears in [ClusterInventory.Clusters]
//     with Status [StatusUnknown] and the error text, and its rendered
//     workloads are STILL listed — each with Status [StatusUnknown] and no
//     pods. A UI can then say "16 workloads, state unknown" instead of
//     showing nothing, which is the same silence the check was written to
//     end.
//   - A workload the render could not route to any cluster is listed with
//     an empty Cluster and Status [StatusUnknown].
