// Package doctor runs two DIFFERENT question sets, and keeping them apart
// is the point of this package's shape:
//
//   - PROJECT HEALTH — "is this project well-formed?" Deployability of the
//     rendered manifests, payload caps, disowned files, toolchain. These
//     read the project's own emitted artefacts, span every declared
//     environment, and need nothing running. `forge doctor` is exactly this
//     set, which is why it takes no `--env`: it never asks about one.
//
//   - ENV RUNTIME — "is the stack for environment X up and reachable?" The
//     compose infra, the app's /healthz, pprof, the telemetry backends,
//     Delve. Every one of these needs a resolved ADDRESS, and doctor has no
//     business inventing one. `forge env status <env>` owns the resolver
//     (it renders the same KCL `forge env up` does and overlays the ports
//     the live stack actually bound), so it is the caller for this set and
//     it supplies the addresses via [RuntimeTarget].
//
// The split exists because doctor used to straddle both and lied about the
// second half: it guessed the app was on :8080, missed a project serving on
// :3091, and rendered the miss as a gray dash indistinguishable from "not
// applicable" — while `forge env status` sat next to it reporting the real
// port, holder pid, ownership and build freshness. There is now ONE resolver
// for "what port does this component serve on", and it is not in here.
//
// The package wraps two surfaces:
//
//   - Free Check* functions (CheckDocker, CheckAppHealth, CheckPprof,
//     CheckPrometheus, CheckTempo, CheckLoki, CheckPyroscope, CheckDelve,
//     plus the deployability set) are individual probes. They are exposed
//     at package level so callers can build their own check sets, and they
//     are the primary unit of test coverage.
//
//   - [Service] is the behavioural seam: it builds a doctor, registers a
//     check set, runs it in the documented order (sequential stage
//     discovers ports for the parallel stage), and pretty-prints the
//     report. CLI-side callers depend on the Service so tests can swap in a
//     fake report.
//
// Data carriers (CheckResult, Report, Environment, Status) remain plain
// types — they describe the outcome, they do not behave.
