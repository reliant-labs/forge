// deploy_config_drift.go — "does every frontend the deploy graph
// declares have code forge can actually build?"
//
// internal/cli/generate_config_check.go walks the other way: for each
// frontend forge.yaml DECLARES, does its path exist on disk. Its header
// names the principle — a silent skip was "the #1 source of 'I added a
// service but generate did nothing' friction" — but it can only
// cross-check what forge.yaml still declares, so a frontend that exists
// in the deploy graph and NOT in the project config falls in the blind
// spot that file was written to close.
//
// This check used to ask a NARROWER question, and the narrow one is now
// gone. It asked "is the frontend absent from forge.yaml", on the
// premise that `forge build --target <name>` resolved its targets from
// cfg.Frontends and would answer:
//
//	Error: target "reliant-web" not found in project config
//
// That premise was itself the bug. forge.yaml's `frontends:` is a
// CODEGEN inventory (config.EffectiveFrontends) — "whose TypeScript does
// this repo generate" — and it deliberately excludes a frontend pinned
// to another repository. Using it to answer a BUILD question conflated
// two different sets, and the remedy this check printed ("add it to
// forge.yaml frontends[]") was the one action that would have been
// actively harmful, since it would project control-plane's generated
// TypeScript into the sibling reliant working tree. build.go's
// resolveNamedBuildTarget now consults the rendered env for the build
// set, so absence from forge.yaml no longer stops anything and is no
// longer worth reporting.
//
// What is left is the case where there is genuinely no code to build:
// the declaration names a path INSIDE this repository and nothing is
// there. `npm run build` cannot run in a directory that does not exist,
// and no other check sees it — the forge.yaml→filesystem walk above only
// covers what forge.yaml lists, which by construction this does not.
//
// Everything else has code forge can reach, and is deliberately silent:
//
//   - a cross-repo `source:` pin is materialized from the pin at build
//     time, which is the entire point of the pin;
//   - a path outside the tree (`../reliant/web`) names a checkout whose
//     presence is a property of the machine, not of this repository's
//     configuration. Reporting it would fail every CI run and pass on
//     every developer's machine, and a verdict that flips with the
//     working copy trains the reader to ignore the whole report;
//   - a frontend in forge.yaml that no environment declares is the
//     ordinary shape of a dev-only frontend.
//
// Severity splits on what the declaration CLAIMS:
//
//   - a `deploy` block is an ERROR. It says "ship this to production",
//     and there is no source tree to produce the artifact from.
//   - `deploy = None` is a WARNING. A build-only frontend makes no
//     shipping claim, so missing code is a likely oversight — often a
//     declaration written ahead of `forge scaffold frontend` — rather
//     than a contradiction.
//
// Frontends are the whole check because they are the only component kind
// with a source tree forge shells into. A service in KCL that names no
// code is already reported by lint's component-drift rule against
// deploy/kcl/workloads.k.
