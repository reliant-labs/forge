// CheckDeploySecrets failed a project for a plaintext credential in ANY
// environment, including dev and e2e. forge's own KCL schema does not agree
// with that: RenderedSecretKey's check permits `from = "literal"` when
// option("env") is dev or e2e, and refuses it everywhere else —
//
//	"RenderedSecretKey(from='literal') is only allowed in dev/e2e —
//	 other envs must not inline secret values"
//
// The two halves of forge therefore disagreed about the same question, and
// the doctor's half is the one that is wrong. A dev credential is
// `postgres:postgres` against a database bound to the developer's own
// machine; an e2e credential is a throwaway that the test's own assertions
// hold the other half of, and that says `do-not-use-in-prod` in the value.
// Neither is a secret in any sense that a Secret would protect: routing them
// through one adds a provisioning step to `task dev-up` and hides a value
// that has to stay greppable when a per-worktree database name is wrong.
//
// The cost of the disagreement is not pedantic. On a real project it left 16
// permanently-red findings that could never be fixed, which is how a check
// stops being read at all — and the findings that matter are the ones in
// prod, sitting in the same list.
