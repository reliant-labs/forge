// disk.go — the "Disk" check.
//
// It reports the two numbers that actually predict a disk-full failure on a
// developer machine, and the activation state of the storage policy that is
// supposed to prevent one.
//
// WHY THE OBVIOUS NUMBERS ARE THE WRONG ONES
//
// Docker Desktop's VM disk is a 1 TiB SPARSE file. Every percent-of-disk
// reading taken inside the VM therefore says "nearly empty" forever: the VM
// sees `/dev/vda1 1007G, 149G used` while the Mac it runs on is out of
// space. `docker info` exposes neither size nor free, and `docker system df`
// reports only the size of Docker objects — not what the host gave up to
// hold them. So every threshold expressed as a percentage, inside the VM or
// out of it, is blind to the failure being guarded against.
//
// The two decisive numbers are both on the HOST and both readable without
// Docker:
//
//   - host free/total bytes, by statfs. Taken for the PROJECT directory and
//     for os.TempDir() separately, because they are not always the same
//     filesystem — a build writes scratch to one and output to the other,
//     and either can be the one that runs out.
//   - Docker.raw's ALLOCATED bytes — st_blocks*512, what `du` reports — not
//     its apparent size. The apparent size of the file on this machine is
//     1,099,511,627,776 bytes on the day it holds 90 GiB. Reading `ls`'s
//     number instead of `du`'s is the single mistake that makes a disk
//     report useless, which is why allocated and apparent are BOTH in the
//     evidence: a reader who sees them side by side cannot repeat it.
//
// Docker.raw is absent on OrbStack (dynamic disk, returns space to macOS by
// itself), on colima (fixed-size Lima disk) and on Linux (no VM at all).
// Its absence is therefore not a finding and not a hole — the check simply
// stops reporting a number that does not exist there, silently.
//
// WHY ACTIVATION IS PART OF A DISK CHECK
//
// forge already ships the whole reclaim mechanism: budgets in the machine
// policy, `forge storage gc`, and a daily schedule. On the machine that ran
// out of disk, the policy file existed with no registries registered and no
// schedule installed, so none of it had ever run. A protection that must be
// switched on by hand is a protection that is off, and nothing reported
// that it was off. "Registries registered but no schedule installed" is
// therefore a WARN in its own right, independent of how much space is free
// today: it is the state that guarantees the bytes accumulate.
//
// NO COMMAND THAT CAN HANG
//
// Every fact here comes from statfs, stat, or reading a small local file.
// This check shells out to nothing — not `docker`, not `kubectl` — because
// a doctor check that blocks on an unreachable daemon is how a disk report
// gets removed from the default set. Each probe still runs under its own
// short timeout, since a statfs against a stale network mount can block in
// the kernel.

	diskProbeTimeout = 3 * time.Second
