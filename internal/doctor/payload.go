// payload.go — Connect payload-cap check.
//
// connect-go treats a zero ReadMaxBytes/SendMaxBytes as "no limit"
// ("Setting WithReadMaxBytes to zero allows any message size"), so the
// difference between a 4 MiB cap and an unbounded one is a single
// unassigned struct field. That is a whole class of bug the compiler
// cannot see and no test that only asserts happy-path behaviour will
// catch: the server keeps working, it just also buffers whatever an
// anonymous caller sends it.
//
// The check reads the composition root the project actually compiles —
// cmd/<binary>/cmd/*.go — and asserts that whatever expression feeds
// connect.WithReadMaxBytes / WithSendMaxBytes is provably non-zero at
// that point in the file.
//
// "Provably non-zero" has three shapes, and all three must be accepted or
// the check cries wolf on correct code — which is worse than useless on a
// security gate, because the next FAIL gets ignored too:
//
//   - the field is set in the composite literal,
//   - the field is set by a later selector assignment,
//   - the config value was NORMALIZED in this file before the read. That
//     last one is how forge fixes the ordering hazard at the source:
//     projectServerkitConfig calls skCfg.Normalize() before returning, so
//     the caps are filled in BEFORE anything reads them rather than at
//     serverkit.Run entry, which is too late. A project whose config proto
//     predates the read_max_bytes / send_max_bytes fields has no literal to
//     match on and is still protected entirely by that call.
//
// # HOW "DOES THIS PROJECT SERVE CONNECT HANDLERS?" IS ANSWERED
//
// When no cap appears anywhere the check has to choose between a FAIL that
// names a remotely exploitable hole and a SKIP that says the question does
// not apply. That discriminator used to be a SUBSTRING GREP: any file under
// internal/handlers/ containing the literal text "connect.HandlerOption".
// It was wrong in both directions, and a security check is the worst place
// to be wrong quietly:
//
//   - handlers mounted anywhere else — a composition root that builds the
//     option slice itself, a hand-rolled internal/server/, a generated
//     mount helper that never spells the type — read as "not applicable"
//     and the check reported SKIP on a project that HAD the exposure;
//   - a file merely MENTIONING the type in a doc comment read as proof and
//     the check reported FAIL on a project that did not.
//
// The determination now goes to the artefacts that DECLARE the answer,
// which is the same discipline deploy_config_drift.go follows (cross-check
// the render against config.LoadProjectDir; never read source text):
//
//  1. The composition root's own AST — the cmd/** parse this check already
//     performs. A reference to the connect-go runtime type HandlerOption,
//     or a call to a generated <pkg>connect.New*Handler constructor, is
//     direct proof, resolved through the file's IMPORTS so a local
//     identifier that merely happens to be spelled `connect` cannot fake it
//     and a comment cannot produce it at all.
//  2. The proto descriptor (gen/forge_descriptor.json, read through
//     codegen.ParseServicesFromProtos — "the single authoritative,
//     non-brittle source" per IntrospectComponents). A declared Connect
//     service IS a mounted one: forge generates the mount for every service
//     in the descriptor and serverkit.RequireMounted refuses to boot a
//     binary that left one unmounted. Zero services in a readable
//     descriptor is an equally authoritative "no".
//  3. config.LoadProjectDir's derived Kind, which comes from the project's
//     real sources (deploy/kcl, pkg/app, internal/handlers, proto/services,
//     cmd/<name>/main.go). A cli or library project serves no Connect
//     handlers.
//
// Anything those three cannot settle is UNDETERMINED, never Skip and never
// Fail — see the StatusSkip vs StatusUnknown note in doctor.go. The two
// shapes that land there are named in [mountingVerdict]'s call sites: a
// descriptor that will not parse (or is stale against the protos on disk),
// and a service-shaped project whose descriptor has not been generated yet.
// Both are literally "forge could not obtain the facts", and answering them
// with a confident Skip is the failure this rewrite exists to remove.
