// toolchain.go — Go toolchain health checks.
//
// `task coverage` (and any project-side use of `-covermode=atomic
// -coverprofile=...`) shells out to `go tool covdata` for merging /
// summarising coverage profiles. A subset of auto-installed Go
// toolchains (notably the v0.0.1-go1.26.2 module-cache toolchain) ship
// without `covdata` built — `go tool covdata` returns
// `go: no such tool "covdata"` and the module-cache directory is
// read-only so the binary can't be built post-hoc.
//
// CheckCovdata warns (not fails) when the active toolchain is
// missing covdata, and points at the `go install` workaround. It's
// intentionally a `warn` rather than `fail` because the absence is
// only material to projects that opted into coverage tooling — the
// scaffolded `task coverage` recipe doesn't use `-covermode=atomic`
// for exactly this reason, so most projects won't notice.

// CheckCovdata verifies that `go tool covdata` is available in the
// active Go toolchain. Returns a warning (not a failure) with an
// install hint when the tool is missing.
//
// The probe is `go tool covdata` with NO selector. Exit status alone
// cannot answer the question: covdata has no zero-arg success mode, so a
// PRESENT covdata exits 2 ("error: missing command selector") exactly as
// an ABSENT one does ("go: no such tool"). The previous probe ran
// `go tool covdata help` — `help` is not one of covdata's selectors
// either, so a perfectly healthy toolchain fell through to the catch-all
// and doctor warned `go tool covdata probe failed: exit status 2` on
// every run, naming no fix for a problem that did not exist. Presence is
// decided on the output sentinel, not the exit code.
