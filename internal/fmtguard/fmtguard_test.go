// WHY A TEST AND NOT JUST THE LINTER. `forge lint` AUTO-FIXES formatting by
// default before it gates. That is the right default for a user, and it is
// exactly why an unformatted file on main is expensive here: every agent and
// every contributor who runs `forge lint` gets the same unrelated files
// rewritten in their working tree, and the churn rides into whatever PR they
// open next. Main carried five such files for long enough that it happened on
// every branch. The linter could not catch it, because the linter is the
// thing that silently repaired it.
//
// This guard fails instead of fixing, runs in `go test -short` in about a
// second, and needs no golangci-lint binary.
