// Package forgecompat decides whether the running forge binary may generate
// into a project, from the forge version that project ACTUALLY resolves.
//
// The generator emits code that calls into forge/pkg/* — orm, crud, testkit,
// serverkit. Those are packages in the SINGLE forge module, so the library
// that code compiles against is whatever version the project requires, and
// the symbols it may call are the ones that existed as of THIS binary's
// version. A project pinning a forge OLDER than this binary can therefore
// lack symbols the generated code names.
//
// WHY THIS IS A VERSION COMPARISON AND NOT A SYMBOL PROBE. It used to compile
// a throwaway program against the project's forge/pkg, exercising a
// hand-maintained list of symbols that whoever taught an emitter to call
// something new was expected to extend. That list rotted: forge grew
// `testkit.StubNotConfigured`, nobody added the entry, and a control-plane
// `forge generate` failed in validate with the tree already rewritten.
//
// Generator and runtime ship as one module, so their versions are one number
// and the honest check is an inequality over it: the project's forge must be
// >= the forge doing the generating. That covers every symbol ever added,
// with no registry to forget, and costs one `go list`.
//
// A project resolving forge NEWER than this binary is allowed through: older
// templates calling into a newer library is the ordinary upgrade order.
//
// It lives in its own package, rather than inside the generate command,
// because more than generate needs the answer: `forge env render` advises
// running `forge generate` to refresh a stale .forge-kcl/, and that advice is
// wrong whenever generate would refuse.
