// This file owns the OTHER direction of version skew from forgecompat.go's:
// a binary OLDER than the project's pin.
//
// forgecompat.go's StalePin reasons about the Go half — generated code
// calling into forge/pkg/*, which resolves through the project's module
// graph. There, a project newer than the binary is the ordinary upgrade
// order and fine.
//
// The KCL half does not work that way. forge's KCL schema module is
// EMBEDDED IN THE BINARY (internal/kclvendor materializes it from
// //go:embed), so the schema a render evaluates against is the binary's, not
// the project's. A project that declares forge v0.1.43 is entitled to every
// field v0.1.43's schemas have; rendering it with a v0.1.42 binary evaluates
// its KCL against v0.1.42's schemas, and KCL reports the missing field as an
// error ON THE PROJECT'S LINE:
//
//	deploy/kcl/dev/main.k:2933: Cannot add member 'runtime_type' to schema 'Workload'
//
// That message is true about what KCL saw and wrong about whose mistake it
// is, and it names neither version. It cost an agent real time reading line
// 2933 as the fault. Naming the skew is the whole fix.

// SkewOverrideEnv lets a user proceed past the refusal. Pre-1.0 forge owes
// no compatibility, but a wall with no door is its own defect — someone
// debugging forge itself, or rendering a project whose pin is wrong, needs
// to get through. Set to any non-empty value.
