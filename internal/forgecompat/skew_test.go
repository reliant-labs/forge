// TestDecideRefusesBinaryBehindPin is the regression this file exists for.
//
// A control-plane pinned to forge v0.1.43 was generated with an installed
// v0.1.42 binary. forge's KCL schema module is EMBEDDED in the binary, so the
// older binary carried the older schema — and the render failed on a field
// that only exists in v0.1.43 with KCL's own diagnostic, pointing at
// `deploy/kcl/dev/main.k:2933`. That message blames the project's KCL for a
// field the project is entitled to use, and names neither version.
//
// Decide used to wave this through: it only refused when the project was
// OLDER than the binary (StalePin), and returned OK for a newer pin on the
// grounds that "older templates calling into a newer library is the ordinary
// upgrade order". That reasoning holds for the Go library half and NOT for
// the KCL half, because the schema does not come from the project's module
// graph — it comes from the binary.
