// The project drift probe — the ONE answer to "which forge-owned files
// were hand-edited after forge wrote them?".
//
// checksums.ScanTier1Drift is the raw signal: every self-certifying file
// whose embedded forge:hash marker fails to verify, plus every
// comment-incapable output whose recorded body hash mismatches. That raw
// set needs exactly one adjustment before any consumer may act on it:
// the Tier-2-managed starters (Dockerfile, Taskfile.yml, .golangci.yml,
// the one-shot .github scaffolds …) carry a marker so `forge project
// upgrade` can tell "still pristine" from "user customized it" — editing
// them is SANCTIONED, so their drift is not drift.
//
// This file owns that adjustment, and it lives here (next to
// Tier2ManagedPaths, the registry that defines the exemption) rather than
// in any one command so that every gate reads the same set:
//
//   - `forge generate`'s pre-pipeline stomp guard (internal/cli),
//   - `forge lint`'s generated-file drift gate (internal/cli/lint),
//   - `forge project audit`'s codegen category,
//   - `forge ci verify-generated`.
//
// A finding that gates one surface and not another is a bug, not a
// policy — hence one probe.

//   - files forge never wrote carry no marker;
//   - a pristine render of an OLDER vintage verifies against its own
//     embedded hash, so "the user hasn't re-run generate yet" is Pristine,
//     not drift;
//   - formatter-only byte churn on .go files re-hashes to the certified
//     render after canonical formatting and is likewise Pristine.
