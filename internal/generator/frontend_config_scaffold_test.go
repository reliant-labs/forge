// The frontend config system — the typed zod module (src/lib/config_gen.ts),
// the KCL schema (deploy/kcl/frontend_config_gen.k) and the per-env
// config.js assigning window.__FORGE_CONFIG__ — is keyed entirely on a
// message-level (forge.v1.frontend_config) annotation. All three generators
// are correct: given an annotated message they emit all three artifacts.
//
// Given NO annotated message they correctly emit NOTHING, and that is the
// state every scaffolded project shipped in: `forge project new X --frontend
// web` wrote a config proto declaring only AppConfig, so a fresh project got
// none of the system and its frontend kept reading build-time
// process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_* — the exact shape the config system exists to
// replace, and one that cannot be promoted between environments because a
// bundler inlines it.
//
// Every prior verification of the config system passed because it HAND-WROTE
// the annotation. Nobody checked the scaffold default, so the feature was
// complete and unreachable at the same time. These tests check the scaffold
// default: they assert the annotation is DECLARED by scaffolding, which is
// what makes the rest of the system run without a hand edit.

// frontendConfigMessageRE finds the frontend-bound config message and
// captures the frontend name the annotation binds it to. Matching the
// ANNOTATION rather than a message name is deliberate: the binding is by
// annotation everywhere else in forge, so renaming the message must not
// break this test and must not silently re-point the config.
