// PinLayout names WHICH node_modules a frontend's tsconfig peer pins resolve
// against.
//
// A `paths` value for a non-wildcard key must hold EXACTLY ONE element — SWC
// asserts that rule and panics `next build` on anything longer (measured; see
// webruntimepeers). So forge cannot list both layouts and let the toolchain
// choose: it has to name the one this project actually has, which makes this a
// decision procedure rather than a lookup.
//
// # The two layouts, and what each pin does in each
//
// Measured end-to-end against control-plane's internal-console, both `tsc
// --noEmit` and `next build`:
//
//	layout                     "./node_modules/…"   "../../node_modules/…"
//	standalone (npm ci here)   green                green (pin dangles, inert)
//	workspace (hoisted root)   TS2322               green
//
// The asymmetry is the whole design. A pin that names a directory holding the
// package is right; a pin that names a directory that does not exist is not an
// error tsc reports — it silently no-ops and resolution falls back to the
// ordinary upward walk. In a standalone project that walk finds the one real
// copy and nothing is harmed. In a BRIDGED project it finds the linked
// runtime's own private copy first, and two physically distinct installs are
// two distinct types:
//
//	src/lib/mock-transport_gen.ts(158,5): error TS2322: Type
//	'…/forge/web-runtime/node_modules/@connectrpc/connect/…'.Transport is not
//	assignable to type '…/<project>/node_modules/@connectrpc/connect/…'.Transport
//
// So "hoisted" is the answer that is merely redundant when wrong, and "local"
// is the answer that breaks a build when wrong.
//
// # Why this returns a KNOWN flag instead of just a bool
//
// tsconfig.json is generated AND COMMITTED, and consumers re-run `forge
// generate` in CI and fail the build on any diff. A decision that reads
// untracked state therefore generates one file on a developer's machine and a
// different one on a runner, from the same commit.
//
// That is not hypothetical, and forge shipped it: control-plane's root
// package.json IS forge's own dev web-runtime bridge (frontend_webruntime_devlink.go)
// and is GITIGNORED by construction, while node_modules is a build artifact
// absent from a fresh checkout. A maintainer's tree has both, so the probe
// answered "hoisted" and the committed pins say "../../node_modules/…". A CI
// checkout has NEITHER, so the same probe answered "local" and rewrote all 14
// pins to "./node_modules/…" — turning Verify Generated Code red on a file
// nobody had touched, on a clean clone of main.
//
// Reading only tracked files does not rescue it either, and this is the part
// worth stating plainly: from tracked files alone a bridged project is
// INDISTINGUISHABLE from a standalone one. control-plane's tracked evidence —
// a per-frontend package.json naming the registry range "^0.3.1", a
// per-frontend package-lock.json, no root manifest — is exactly what a plain
// standalone project looks like. The signal that says otherwise is ignored on
// purpose, so no amount of preferring tracked inputs can recover it.
//
// The resolution is to stop forcing an answer. When the evidence identifies a
// layout, forge retargets and heals a stale pin. When it does not, forge
// leaves the committed value alone: that value is itself a tracked, reviewed
// declaration of the layout, and respecting it makes generate a fixed point in
// every environment. Silence is a third state, not a vote for the default.
