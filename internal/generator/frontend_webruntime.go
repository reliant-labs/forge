// Package generator — @reliantlabs/forge-web-runtime dependency resolution for
// generated frontends.
//
// Generated frontends import @reliantlabs/forge-web-runtime (the web twin of
// forge/pkg): connect.ts builds its interceptor stack from it, providers.tsx
// mounts RuntimeShell, the CRUD list pages render <Resource>. It is therefore
// a REAL dependency of shipped application code and belongs in
// "dependencies", never "devDependencies" — a production install
// (`npm ci --omit=dev`, the Next.js standalone Docker image) has to resolve
// it or `next build` fails.
//
// Which specifier to write is the whole job here, and it is the npm mirror of
// what project_pkgdep.go decides for forge/pkg:
//
//   - RELEASE flow: an ordinary semver range (webRuntimePublishedRange).
//     A released forge scaffolds a project that resolves the package from the
//     registry like any other dependency. A release build never emits a
//     `file:` specifier — the path would be meaningless on the user's disk.
//
//   - DEV flow: `file:<path-to-the-running-forge's-web-runtime>`. npm's
//     file: protocol symlinks the directory into node_modules, so a dev
//     forge's frontend resolves the package straight out of the checkout —
//     edits to web-runtime/src land in the project with nothing published,
//     nothing pushed and no reinstall. Because the dependency is DECLARED,
//     `npm install` maintains the link instead of pruning it, which a bare
//     symlink into node_modules could never survive.
//
// The dev path is written RELATIVE ("../../../../forge/web-runtime") or
// home-anchored ("~/src/forge/web-runtime") — never absolute. An absolute
// path carries the maintainer's home directory and username into a committed
// file, and npm resolves both of the other forms natively. When neither form
// can be expressed without embedding one, forge writes no dev specifier at
// all and says why.

// webRuntimePublishedRange is a MINIMUM, not an exact pin, and reconcileSpec

//
// THE DEFECT THIS FIXES. Every generate rewrote the specifier to forge's own
// constant, unconditionally. So a project that had deliberately moved AHEAD of
// forge — the motivating case is a security bump published between two forge
// releases — was silently DOWNGRADED on the next `forge generate`, back to a
// range that resolves the vulnerable version. Nothing reported it: the rewrite
// is silent by design (it is idempotent bookkeeping), so the only evidence was
// a package.json diff nobody was looking for and a lockfile that quietly moved
// back.
//
// That is forge overriding a decision that is not forge's to make. forge's
// constant states the OLDEST web-runtime this generator's output is known to
// work against; it says nothing about newer ones, which are compatible by
// semver construction within the same major. A project pinning higher has more
// information than forge does — it knows about a release forge predates.
//
// So the rule is a floor, applied in the one direction that is forge's
// business:
//
//   - current is semver-GREATER THAN OR EQUAL to forge's minimum → keep the
//     project's specifier. It already satisfies the floor.
//   - current is BELOW the floor → raise it. This is the case forge exists to
//     fix: a project regenerated by a newer forge whose output needs a newer
//     runtime.
//   - current is not a comparable version range (a `file:` bridge, a git or
//     npm-alias specifier, anything unparseable) → forge's answer wins, which
//     preserves the stale-bridge normalisation above. "Not comparable" must
//     not be read as "higher"; an unparseable specifier has made no claim.
//
// Comparison is on the MINIMUM version each range admits, because that is the
// only thing a floor can be compared against. `^0.3.2` and `~0.3.2` and
// `>=0.3.2` all admit 0.3.2 as their lowest, so all three clear a 0.3.2 floor;
