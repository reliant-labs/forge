// Package generator — the DEV bridge from a project's frontends to a local
// @reliantlabs/forge-web-runtime checkout.
//
// This is the npm mirror of what forge already does for Go, and the shape is
// deliberately the same one:
//
//	Go: a gitignored `go.work` bridges the project to a sibling forge/pkg
//	    checkout. go.mod keeps its published pin. Nothing machine-specific is
//	    committed, and a clone that lacks the sibling still builds.
//
//	JS: a gitignored npm workspace ROOT (package.json + .forge-link/) bridges
//	    the project's frontends to a sibling forge/web-runtime checkout. Each
//	    frontend's package.json keeps its published range. Nothing
//	    machine-specific is committed, and a clone that lacks the sibling
//	    still installs.
//
// # Why the bridge cannot simply be a symlink
//
// npm owns node_modules. A bare symlink dropped into
// node_modules/@reliantlabs/ has no corresponding edge in the dependency
// graph, so the next install that reshapes the tree replaces it with the
// registry copy and the developer silently goes back to testing published
// code. The link has to be something npm itself computes.
//
// The previous design got that right and paid for it in the wrong currency:
// it rewrote the specifier to `file:<path>` inside frontends/<name>/package.json,
// a TRACKED file. That left every maintainer's `git status` permanently dirty,
// made the diff meaningless to review, and made it easy to commit a path that
// resolves only on a machine with a sibling forge checkout at exactly that
// depth — which breaks CI and every other developer.
//
// # The mechanism
//
// A workspace root ABOVE the frontends, both parts of it gitignored:
//
//	<project>/package.json      { "workspaces": ["frontends/web", …, ".forge-link/*"] }
//	<project>/.forge-link/web-runtime -> ../../forge/web-runtime   (symlink)
//
// npm reads the root, sees a workspace member whose package.json declares the
// name @reliantlabs/forge-web-runtime, and hoists it to <project>/node_modules
// as a link. The frontends' own `"^0.3.1"` requirement resolves against that
// member by NAME, so the tracked manifests never mention a path. Node's
// resolution walks up from frontends/<name>/, finds the hoisted link, and lands
// in the live checkout — verified by require.resolve pointing straight into
// forge/web-runtime/dist, and by an edit to that file being visible to the next
// import with no reinstall.
//
// Three properties this buys that the alternatives do not:
//
//   - The tracked package.json AND package-lock.json are both untouched. An
//     in-frontend overlay (workspaces + a link dir inside the frontend) also
//     keeps package.json clean, but npm records the member in the frontend's
//     OWN package-lock.json — measured — so the churn simply moves to the
//     other tracked file. Hoisting to a root the frontend does not own is what
//     keeps both clean.
//   - A stale registry copy already installed under frontends/<name>/node_modules
//     does not shadow the link: the root install REMOVES it (measured: "added 2
//     packages, and removed 5 packages", after which require.resolve pointed at
//     the checkout).
//   - `npm install` run from INSIDE a frontend still honours the root
//     workspace and leaves the nested lockfile byte-identical (measured).
//
// The symlink points at the checkout with a RELATIVE path, and the root
// manifest names no path at all, so — as with `go.work` — even these ignored
// files carry no username and no home directory.
//
// Everything here is gated on a dev build with a discoverable forge source
// root. A released binary writes none of it: the workspace root is a
// maintainer's dev-loop artifact, and scattering one into a user's project
// would change how their install resolves for no benefit.
