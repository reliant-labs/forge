// writeConstraintConstants emits the per-entity constraint-name constants:

// just above it.
//
// They exist because orm.ConstraintName(err) returns a string and a service
// has to compare it against SOMETHING. Without a generated constant the only
// option is a literal beside the branch, which is precisely the drift the
// column constants exist to prevent: rename the constraint in a migration
// and the build stays green while the branch silently stops matching. The
// constant makes the rename a compile error at every reader.
//
// The value is postgres's own name, carried verbatim from the catalog. Forge
// never derives it — postgres auto-names inline constraints (`_key`,
// `_check`, `_check1`), and a name forge computed that disagreed with the
// one postgres reports would be worse than no constant at all, because it
// reads as authoritative.
