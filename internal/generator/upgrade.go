		// written by the codegen pipeline's writeForgeScaffoldOnce.
		//
		//   - serve.go   the serve pipeline. Every statement is a decision:
		//                the fail-closed auth posture, the interceptor order,
		//                the payload caps, the CORS policy, the readiness
		//                set, the teardown.
		//   - server.go  the all-services ServeSpec — what this process
		//                mounts and supervises, and whether an unmounted
		//                declared service fails boot.
		//   - version.go the three ldflags-stamped variables. `-X` targets a
		//                variable by package path, so these MUST live in the
		//                project's tree and renaming one is a build change.
		//   - db.go      migration policy: fail hard on a dirty schema vs
		//                auto-force in staging, whether "nothing pending" is
		//                success, whether `down` is guarded.

		// The invariant steps they used to carry moved into pkg/serverkit
		// (Boot / AutoMigrate / RecordMounted / AddWorkers / RequireComplete /
		// RESTHandler), pkg/cmdkit (PrintVersion) and pkg/migratekit (the
		// migrator, the DSN rewrite, the sentinel folding). That is what makes
		// scaffold-once safe: improvements to them now arrive through a
		// forge/pkg bump instead of a re-render, so owning these files no
		// longer costs the user the upgrade path.
		//
		//   - root.go    the command TREE: its shape, its flags, the Deps
		//                struct threaded through it. Users customize the
		//                binary's cobra root, and hash-guarding it made
		//                every such edit an act of permanent drift. It now
		//                also carries ServiceName and wires `db migrate`
		//                directly — see the root_gen.go retirement note.
		//
		// EVERY ONE of them also needs an UpgradeManagedPaths entry — they
		// were Tier-1 in older projects, so a copy is on disk carrying
		// forge's certification marker that no run writes anymore. See the
		// exclusion list there; without it `--force-cleanup` deletes them.
		//
		// cmd/<bin>/cmd/root_gen.go is RETIRED — there is no generated file in
		// the command tree anymore. It held three things, and none of them
		// earned a regenerated file:
		//
		//   - ServiceName, the forge.yaml project name. Fixed at scaffold;
		//     it moves only in a rename the user is performing by hand
		//     anyway. Now a const in root.go.
		//   - migrationSource/Dir. The derived half — whether MigrationsFS is
		//     referenceable at all — is real, but it is a fact about the db
		//     package, so it lives there now as db.Source() (db/source_gen.go)
		//     and the command tree just calls it.
		//   - generatedCommands, which encoded one bit: does this project have
		//     migrations. root.go is itself rendered with that bit at scaffold
		//     time (as serve.go and db.go already were), so it wires
		//     newDBCmd directly.
