// The scaffold-once advisory lane of `forge project upgrade`.
//
// Forge writes three kinds of file:
//
//   - Tier-1 — re-rendered every `forge generate`, self-certifying, gated
//     by the drift probe (drift.go).
//   - Tier-2 managed — written once, checksum-protected, and kept current
//     by `forge project upgrade` when the on-disk copy is still a pristine
//     render (buf.yaml, Taskfile.yml, Dockerfile, .golangci.yml, …).
//   - scaffold-once ("yours") — written once at birth with NO marker, and
//     never touched again. The frontend mechanism modules
//     (src/lib/query-client.ts, src/lib/events.ts, src/hooks/*) and
//     everything under .github/ are this tier.
//
// The third tier had no feedback path at all. When forge IMPROVED one of
// those templates, every existing project stayed on its birth copy and
// nothing anywhere said so. That is not hypothetical: a shipped
// query-client.ts kept a blanket `retry: 1` that retried 4xx long after
// the template replaced it with an `isRetryable` predicate, and the
// events.ts it depends on was missing the `emitToast` the new client
// imports. Both were found by a human reading templates, not by forge.
//
// This file closes that loop WITHOUT breaking the ownership contract:
//
//	report, never apply.
//
// An advisory row is rendered from the current template and compared with
// what is on disk. A difference is printed — never written — unless the
// user names that exact path after --force. Bare --force deliberately does
// NOT reach this tier: a flag that names nothing cannot express intent
// about a file forge handed over at birth, and the whole point of the tier
// is that adoption is the user's call.
//
// Membership is derived, not hand-listed. The frontend rows are exactly
// the files that win composition from the SHARED template roots
// (templates.FrontendTemplateRoots) — the roots whose stated job is
// "generic mechanism modules … rendered into ALL frontend kinds". A new
// shared mechanism module is covered the day it lands, with no second
// registry to forget to update; forgetting to update a registry is the
// bug class this whole file exists to fix.
//
// A row may only be added when the project has exactly ONE renderer for
// that path. That rule is why the GitHub Actions workflows are absent even
// though they are the same tier and were part of the same incident: forge
// renders .github/workflows/* from two different config→data mappings —
// project_ci.go at `forge project new` time and generate_ci.go's
// buildCIWorkflowData afterwards — and on a project seconds old they
// disagree (a whole docker-build job in ci.yml, the env list in
// deploy.yml). Reporting that difference would report forge's own
// inconsistency as the user's staleness, on the loudest file in the repo,
// for every project. The prerequisite is one CI mapper, not a smarter
// comparison; until then this lane stays quiet about them rather than
// train everyone to skip the section.
//
// The two non-workflow .github starters have a single renderer and are in.
