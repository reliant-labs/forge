// Per-kind frontend membership for the scaffold-once advisory lane.
//
// The lane began by covering only the SHARED template roots, on the
// reasoning (still correct) that a shared root is forge's own declaration
// of "this file is generic mechanism I own the design of". That is a sound
// rule for deciding what forge should OWN. It is the wrong rule for
// deciding what forge should REPORT, and the difference is the bug this
// file fixes.
//
// The symptom: frontends/<name>/eslint.config.mjs is written from
// internal/templates/frontend/<kind>/eslint.config.mjs and then never
// mentioned again by any forge command. Hand-edit it and `forge project
// upgrade --check` is completely silent — while .golangci.yml, the same
// kind of lint config on the backend side, prints a diff and both remedies
// because it happens to be a Tier-2 managed file. Same class of file, same
// user gesture, opposite outcome, decided by which registry it landed in.
//
// The rule applied here is deliberately generic, and NOT about lint files:
//
//	if forge wrote it from a template, its drift is reportable.
//
// Registering eslint.config.mjs by name would have fixed the reported
// symptom and left the bug — the next per-kind template forge adds would be
// invisible in exactly the same way. So membership is DERIVED from the
// template tree, and what this file states instead is the far smaller set
// of exclusions, each of which is a file another lane already renders.
//
// ── Reporting a file is not claiming it ───────────────────────────────
//
// Nothing here changes ownership. These files stay scaffold-once: no
// forge:hash marker, no manifest entry, never written unless the user names
// the exact path after --force. The advisory lane reports and does not
// apply, which is what makes widening it safe — the cost of a new row is a
// diff the user can ignore, not a file forge starts overwriting.
//
// ── Why the exclusions are exclusions ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The lane's standing admission rule is that a row may exist only when the
// project has exactly ONE renderer for that path. That rule is why the
// .github WORKFLOWS are absent (two config→data mappings disagree about
// them on a project seconds old, so reporting the difference would report
// forge's own inconsistency as the user's staleness). The same rule
// excludes exactly three groups here, and nothing else:
//
//   - Tier-1 *_gen.* files (apiurl_gen.ts, basepath_gen.ts, otel_gen.ts).
//     Rewritten every `forge generate` and guarded by the drift probe. A
//     row would duplicate a check that already exists and is stricter.
//   - Inventory-seeded files (nav.tsx, dashboard.tsx, page.tsx). The nav
//     generator re-renders these from the DISCOVERED entity set
//     (generate_frontend_nav.go). This lane has the frontend config but not
//     the inventory, so its render would show empty routes against a real
//     project's populated ones — a large, permanent, entirely bogus diff.
//   - src/gen/ and the mock surface, written per-entity from a different
//     registry for the same reason.
//   - Files the MANAGED lane registers (upgrade_frontend_managed.go —
//     today, eslint.config.mjs). Two lanes, one file: `--check` listed it
//     twice, once as a managed Tier-2 entry and once as an advisory row.
//     Cosmetic in the report, but the two lanes disagree about who owns
//     the file, and they do not offer the same thing — managed refreshes
//     a pristine copy and offers `disown`, advisory only ever reports.
//     The managed lane wins because it deliberately claimed the file (see
//     that file's header: symmetry with .golangci.yml, and it is the only
//     lane through which a template improvement actually ARRIVES).
//
// Everything else in the per-kind tree renders from the frontend's own
// config, which this lane has, so it is admitted.
