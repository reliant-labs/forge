// The per-kind frontend rows.
//
// The advisory lane originally covered only the SHARED template roots, on
// the reasoning that a shared root is forge's own declaration of "this file
// is mechanism I own the design of". That reasoning is sound for deciding
// what forge should OWN. It is the wrong rule for deciding what forge should
// REPORT, and the gap it left was not theoretical: frontends/<name>/
// eslint.config.mjs is a file forge writes from a template and then never
// mentions again, in any command, ever. Hand-edit it and `forge project
// upgrade --check` says nothing at all — while .golangci.yml, the same kind
// of lint config on the backend side, reports a diff and both remedies
// because it is a Tier-2 managed file.
//
// The rule these tests pin is the generic one:
//
//	if forge wrote it from a template, its drift is reportable.
//
// Not "if it is a lint file". Registering eslint.config.mjs by name would
// re-create the same bug for the next per-kind template — so membership is
// derived from the template tree, exactly as the shared rows are, and these
// tests assert the DERIVATION rather than a list.

// perKindFrontendCfg describes a project with one frontend of the given
// template tree, at the conventional path.
