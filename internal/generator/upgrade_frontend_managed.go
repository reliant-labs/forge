// Per-frontend Tier-2 managed files.
//
// `forge project upgrade` has two lanes, and the difference between them is
// the whole point of this file:
//
//	the ADVISORY lane (upgrade_advisory.go) REPORTS. It says "the template
//	moved on, here is the diff" and never writes unless the exact path is
//	named after --force. It reports staleness in one direction only —
//	template content the file lacks — so a file the user merely ADDED to is
//	silent, and there is no `disown`, because a file forge handed over at
//	birth was never forge's to be disowned from.
//
//	the MANAGED lane (upgrade.go) TRACKS. A pristine render is refreshed
//	automatically on upgrade; an edited one is reported as `user-modified
//	(skipped)` with a diff and BOTH remedies — `--force <path>` to adopt,
//	`disown` to claim.
//
// frontends/<name>/eslint.config.mjs was in NEITHER, which is the reported
// bug: hand-edit it and no forge command mentions it, ever. `.golangci.yml`
// — the same kind of file on the backend side — is a Tier-2 managed file
// and reports exactly as described above.
//
// It is registered here in the MANAGED lane rather than the advisory one
// for two reasons, and the second is load-bearing:
//
//  1. Symmetry with .golangci.yml is what was actually asked for: the same
//     file class should behave the same way on both sides of the stack,
//     including the two remedies. The advisory lane cannot offer `disown`
//     and cannot report a pure addition.
//
//  2. It is the only lane that makes template improvements ARRIVE. An
//     advisory row tells you a rule exists; a managed file DELIVERS it to
//     every project whose copy is still pristine. That distinction decided
//     the design of the frontend process.env guardrail, which documented
//     the constraint precisely: "eslint.config.mjs is SCAFFOLD-ONCE … not
//     in generator.managedFiles(), so `forge project upgrade` never
//     refreshes it — a rule added there would reach projects created after
//     this change and NO existing project". Registering it here is what
//     retires that objection.
//
// ── Tier 2, not Tier 1 ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A lint config is a file users legitimately edit — a project-specific rule,
// a disabled check, an extra ignore. Tier-1 would stomp that every generate.
// Tier-2 is the tier whose contract is exactly "keep it current while it is
// untouched, and never stomp an edit": reporting drift is not the same as
// forge owning the file.
//
// ── Why these entries carry a render closure ──────────────────────────
//
// Every other managedFile names a template in the project/ category and
// writes to a fixed path. These are neither: the template is one per
// frontend KIND (internal/templates/frontend/<kind>/eslint.config.mjs) and
// the destination is one per declared FRONTEND. So the entries are
// generated per frontend with their render attached — see managedFile.render.
