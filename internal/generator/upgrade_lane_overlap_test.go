// `forge project upgrade` has two lanes and they must not both claim a
// file. frontends/<name>/eslint.config.mjs was in both: it printed twice
// under `--check`, once from the managed Tier-2 registration and once from
// the scaffold-once advisory sweep.
//
// The duplicate line is the cosmetic part. The real problem is that the
// lanes disagree about ownership and do not offer the same thing — managed
// refreshes a pristine copy on upgrade and offers `disown`, advisory only
// ever reports — so a user following one lane's remedy is being told a
// different story about the same file than the other lane tells.
//
// Asserted as a set-disjointness property over every frontend kind rather
// than as "eslint is not in the advisory list", so the NEXT file registered
// in both lanes fails here too.
