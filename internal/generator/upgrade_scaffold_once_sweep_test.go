// File: internal/generator/upgrade_scaffold_once_sweep_test.go
//
// The data-loss guard for tier FLIPS.
//
// `forge generate`'s stale-artifact sweep (internal/cli/generate_cleanup.go)
// is marker-driven: a file carrying forge's certification marker that no run
// wrote is a stale candidate, and `--force-cleanup` DELETES a pristine
// candidate. That is correct for a renamed service's leftover handler.
//
// It is data loss for a file that changed TIER. When a command-tree template
// moves from Tier-1 (regenerated every run) to scaffold-once (written once,
// then the user's), every project scaffolded before the flip still has a copy
// on disk carrying the old markers — and after the flip nothing writes it, so
// it never enters WrittenThisRun. The sweep reads "certified, not written this
// run" and flags it. Pristine is the common case (the user never edited it),
// and pristine is exactly the condition under which the sweep deletes rather
// than reports. So the user loses their serve pipeline, their ServeSpec, their
// version stamp, or their migration policy.
//
// generator.UpgradeManagedPaths() carries an explicit exclusion for each such
// path. This test derives the REQUIRED set from the templates' own banners
// rather than from a hand-maintained list, so the next tier flip cannot ship
// the same data loss by forgetting an entry.
