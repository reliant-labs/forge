// TestFrontendManagedSkipsSourcedFrontend pins a DELIBERATE behavior
// change made when FrontendConfig.Path was unexported.
//
// The retired EffectivePath returned the conventional frontends/<name>
// label for a frontend whose code is in another repository, and this
// lane used it unguarded. So forge registered a MANAGED file at
// frontends/sibling-web/eslint.config.mjs — a path no frontend occupies.
// Managed files are written and rewritten on every upgrade, and the
// stale-artifact sweep then keeps the invented file alive, so forge would
// create and maintain a lint config for a frontend that is not there.
//
// The real tree belongs to another repository, whose own forge manages
// its lint config. Skipping is the correct answer.

// TestFrontendAdvisorySkipsSourcedFrontend is the same change on the
// advisory lane, where the consequence is a report rather than a write:
// every template file was compared against a tree that does not exist,
// so the whole frontend was reported as drifted-or-missing on every
// `forge upgrade`. An advisory about a directory that is not there is
// noise, and it is noise about files this project does not own.
