// The postgres probe must be BOUNDED when the declared port is held by
// something that is not postgres.
//
// This is a regression test for a real hang, found while building the
// host-infra observer and reproduced below. It is not an observation-only
// concern: identifyHolder is on the DEPLOY path too — startPostgres calls
// it whenever it cannot find an instance of its own — so the same silent
// hang takes `forge env up` with it.
//
// # The mechanism, because it is not the obvious one
//
// identifyHolder already wraps its query in a 5-second context. That
// bounds the QUERY, and the query never begins: lib/pq blocks in the
// connection HANDSHAKE, and pq documents that a zero or unspecified
// connect_timeout means wait indefinitely. A context on QueryRowContext
// cannot rescue a connection stuck before it.
//
// So the fix is in the DSN (connect_timeout), and a test that only
// asserted "identifyHolder has a context" would have passed against the
// broken code. This one holds the port open with a listener that accepts
// and then says nothing — exactly what a non-postgres service looks like
// to pq — and asserts the probe RETURNS.

// silentListener accepts connections and never writes a byte, holding
// each one open until the test finishes. This is the shape that hangs
// pq: the TCP connect succeeds, so portListening reports the port held,
// and then the postgres startup handshake waits forever for a reply.
