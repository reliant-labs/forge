// Status is a READ of one declared instance: is it running, where, and
// which build.
//
// It exists as a separate verb rather than a return value of Start
// because the two answer different questions. Start reports whether a
// TRANSITION succeeded, and it may create a data directory, download a
// binary and run a bootstrap to get there. Status never does any of
// that, and a caller may run it against an instance that was never
// started — which is exactly what `forge env observe` needs, and exactly
// what calling Start to find out would get wrong (it would start it).
type Status struct {
	// Running reports whether a server this project owns is serving.
	//
	// Ownership is load-bearing and is why this cannot be a port probe.
	// On a shared dev box the declared port may be held by ANOTHER
	// project's postgres or a system one, and reporting that as "our
	// instance is up" is the same adoption mistake Start refuses to
	// make — it would show green for a database this project has never
	// written to.
	Running bool

	// Foreign reports the specific case of "something is listening on
	// the declared port, and it is not ours". Distinct from !Running
	// with nothing there: one means "start it", the other means "a
	// human must free the port", and collapsing them loses the only
	// actionable half.
	Foreign bool

	// Port is where the instance is ACTUALLY serving, which is not
	// necessarily the declared port: an instance started before the
	// declaration moved is still running on the old one. Zero when not
	// running, and -1 when it is alive but has not published a port yet
	// (mid-boot).
	Port int

	// Version is the engine build the instance is running, empty when
	// unknown. For postgres it is read from the cluster's own PG_VERSION
	// file — the server's record of what initdb created, rather than the
	// declaration's record of what was asked for. Those disagree exactly
	// when someone changed the declared version without recreating the
	// data directory, and that disagreement is the thing worth seeing.
	Version string

	// Ready reports whether the instance ANSWERS, as opposed to merely
	// having a live process. The two come apart during boot and stay
	// apart when a server wedges, and that gap is the whole difference
	// between "a process exists" and "the thing the app is about to dial
	// will respond" — the distinction Start's doc-comment already draws
	// for the write path.
	//
	// Meaningless when Running is false.
