package hostinfra

// Zitadel as a HOST PROCESS — the dev identity provider, run the same way
// postgres is, with no container runtime involved.
//
// # Why this exists
//
// The dev IdP was the last container in a scaffolded dev stack. Postgres
// went host-native first (see hostinfra.go), which left a project WITH a
// frontend needing docker for exactly one thing while a project without one
// needed none at all — a cliff, not a gradient, and it fell on precisely the
// workflow that wants a real browser sign-in.
//
// The reason given for keeping it containerized was that Zitadel is a heavy
// server with a schema and a bootstrap of its own. The bootstrap part is
// true and is preserved verbatim below; the heavy part was wrong about the
// thing that actually matters here. Zitadel is a single static Go binary —
// the same language forge is written in — published for darwin/linux/windows
// on amd64 and arm64. Supervising it is the same problem this package
// already solved for postgres: fetch a pinned archive once, cache it, verify
// it, launch it with explicit directories, wait until it is genuinely
// serving, and stop it by a pid we recorded.
//
// # What is preserved exactly
//
// The DECLARATIVE BOOTSTRAP is untouched. `idp-steps.yaml` still describes
// the instance, the org, the admin human and the service account, still
// arrives via `--steps`, and Zitadel still writes the service-account PAT to
// the path ZITADEL_FIRSTINSTANCE_PATPATH names — which is the file the
// idp-provision job reads. Only the EXECUTION changed from container to host
// process; every declaration, every env var and every file path is the same
// one the compose service used.
//
// # The database
//
// Zitadel needs postgres, and the host-native postgres this package already
// supervises is right there. It gets its OWN database on that server (the
// compose path gave it a whole second container for the same isolation),
// created on demand by ensureNamedDatabase. Two servers become one, and the
// IdP's schema still cannot collide with the app's.
//
// # What is not obvious, and cost time to learn
//
//   - `zitadel -v` is the version probe. There is no `version` SUBCOMMAND —
//     `zitadel version` errors with "unknown command" — so a naive probe
//     reports a broken download for a perfectly good binary.
//   - The archive extracts to a DIRECTORY (`zitadel-<os>-<arch>/zitadel`),
//     not a bare file, so extraction flattens it to a known path rather than
//     trusting the archive's shape at every later use.
//   - Zitadel resolves WHICH instance a request is for from the Host header,
//     matched against the instance's ExternalDomain — not from the socket.
//     That is why the port is deterministic (allocate_port) and why
//     everything, including this process's own readiness probe, reaches it at
//     the same localhost origin the browser uses.
//   - Readiness is NOT "the port accepts connections". On first boot the
//     declarative setup (schema, instance, org, admin user, PAT) runs before
//     it serves, and registering against a listening-but-unconverged IdP
//     fails. `/debug/ready` is Zitadel's own unauthenticated readiness route
//     and is what the compose healthcheck used; it is what this waits on too.
