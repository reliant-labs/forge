// fileread_eval_test.go pins WHICH directory a file's `file.read` resolves
// against, which is the one thing the evaluation's working directory decides.
//
// It is a separate file because getting this wrong is silent. kpm resolves a
// relative `lib.*` import from the file's OWN kcl.mod package, whatever the
// cwd is — so an evaluation that chose the package root as its cwd would
// still import correctly and would still LOOK right. What it would break is
// `file.read`, which takes a path relative to the process cwd: control-plane's
// lib/barman_plugin.k reads "deploy/cnpg/plugin-barman-cloud.yaml", a
// PROJECT-ROOT-relative path, and resolving it from deploy/kcl would fail on
// a missing file — or, worse, read a different file that happened to exist
// there.
//
// So the working directory is the project root, matching `env render` exactly.
// One evaluation semantics for the whole project, not one per file location.
