// Package kcleval evaluates ONE KCL file of a project and selects fields out
// of the result, so nothing outside forge ever has to run `kcl` itself.
//
// # The gap this closes
//
// Since forge started supplying the `forge` KCL module from the binary
// (docs/adr/0003-kcl-module-from-the-binary.md), a plain `kcl run` on a file
// that says `import forge` CANNOT resolve it: there is no kcl.mod dependency
// to fetch and no project-local copy to read. That is deliberate — the binary
// rendering a project IS the module version it renders against — and it is
// also why a consumer with a legitimate need to read a value out of project
// KCL had nowhere to go.
//
// forge's answer was `forge env render <env>`, which evaluates an
// ENVIRONMENT and prints Kubernetes objects. A project also keeps plain
// declarative constants in library files — control-plane's
// `deploy/kcl/lib/kata_pool.k` declares GKE node-pool inputs, its
// `lib/daemon_placement.k` declares which cluster each env's daemon pods land
// in — and those are read by shell scripts and Go tests, not deployed. There
// was no forge command that evaluated an arbitrary FILE and handed back one
// field.
//
// So consumers reconstructed forge's own render setup from outside: a
// control-plane shell library made forge materialize its module into
// FORGE_KCL_MODULE_CACHE, dug the directory out, and ran
// `kcl run <file> -S <field> -E forge=<dir>`. That works right up until any
// part of forge's render setup changes — the cache layout, the module name,
// the plugin namespace — at which point it breaks in a consumer's CI with an
// error about KCL, naming nothing that would lead anyone back here. It also
// requires `kcl` on PATH, which forge itself has not needed since it embedded
// the runtime.
//
// # What this is NOT
//
// Not an env render. Nothing here resolves an image tag, reads build state,
// routes objects to clusters, or templates a helm chart — see
// internal/cli/env_render.go for that. The unit is a file and the output is
// the file's own values.
//
// Not a port claim. Evaluation arms the read-only halves of the render
// context (internal/cli.armReadOnlyKCLContext): `fp.allocate_port` resolves
// keys to blocks they already hold and `fp.resolve_port` reads its store
// without writing it, so evaluating a file can neither hand out a port block
// nor fail at the dev_stack ceiling. A read-only command never claims a port
// block.
//
// # Why selection happens HERE and not in kcl
//
// kcl's own `-S` renders a selected LIST as one YAML document per element,
// which is unusable without knowing how many elements to expect;
// control-plane's check-kata-pool-staleness.sh carries a hand-written
// workaround for exactly this, and a comment explaining that an empty result
// passes a tier name through as data. Selecting in Go against the parsed JSON
// gives back the value KCL actually produced — an array stays one array —
// and it is the same traversal for a scalar, a list and a schema instance.
