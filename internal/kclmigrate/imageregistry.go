// Package kclmigrate rewrites a project's deploy/kcl tree across a forge
// change that moved a declaration from one place to another.
//
// It works TEXTUALLY, on purpose. The obvious alternative — render the env and
// read the resolved values — is not available: the old tree no longer compiles
// against the new schema (the field being migrated is now a closed-schema
// error), so there is nothing to render. Working on text also means the rewrite
// preserves comments, ordering and formatting, which a render-and-reprint would
// destroy.
//
// THE GOVERNING RULE IS THAT THERE IS NO SILENT NO-OP. Every `registry = …` in
// the tree must be ACCOUNTED FOR — rewritten onto an image, dropped with a
// stated reason, or refused with its exact location. A registry the reader
// could not parse, resolve or attribute is a refusal, never a shrug. This is
// the rule the first version lacked: its two matchers missed the styles real
// projects write, so both inputs to its ambiguity check came back empty, it
// found nothing to do, and it reported success on a tree it had not understood.
// The tree then failed minutes later at render, pointing at a schema error with
// no trace of the migration that should have prevented it.

// ImageRegistry migrates a project off env-level registries: it removes

// bare `image`, or ADDING an `image` line to a workload that declared none —
// when, and only when, that is unambiguous.
//
// UNAMBIGUOUS means: across every env where this workload is bound to a runtime
// that PULLS an image, exactly one registry was declared. An env that binds the
// workload OnHost, OnCompose or BuildOnly, or does not bind it at all, is not
// consulted — its registry was never going to be this workload's.
//
// So a project whose dev env declares a localhost registry and binds everything
// to the host, while prod declares ghcr.io and deploys to a cluster, migrates
// cleanly to ghcr.io: dev's registry is DROPPED, because nothing in dev ever
// pulled an image.
//
// EVERYTHING ELSE IS REFUSED, and refusing writes nothing — a partial migration
// would leave the tree in a state neither the old nor the new forge
// understands. There are two refusal kinds and they are equally hard:
//
//   - Ambiguous: the same workload pulls from two different registries.
//     Choosing one silently would point an env at a repository its image was
//     never pushed to. The exact per-env KCL is printed instead.
//   - Unaccounted: a `registry = …` this reader could not resolve to a literal,
//     or whose env binds workloads in a way it could not read. Naming the file
//     and line is the whole point: the alternative is dropping a registry the
//     migration never understood, which is the defect this rule exists for.
//
// USER BINDER EXPRESSIONS ARE NEVER EDITED. Binders are lambdas, and rewriting
// a lambda body is how a migration corrupts a file it does not understand. This
// reads them to learn which runtime each produces, and writes only to
// `registry = …` and `image = …` lines.
