// Package kclrender is the single seam through which forge evaluates KCL.
// It renders via the embedded kpm package manager + kcl-go runtime — no
// external `kcl` binary required on PATH — and registers forge's KCL
// plugin namespace (kcl_plugin.forge.*) so KCL can pull host-runtime
// values (e.g. resolve_port) during evaluation.
//
// kpm reads the package's kcl.mod and resolves dependencies — git, local
// path, and OCI/registry — exactly like the `kcl` CLI, so projects
// declare the forge module (and any extra packages) in kcl.mod in
// whatever style they like; forge neither parses nor special-cases deps.

// These bindings are not cosmetic: a project keys its NAMESPACE on them.
// control-plane's deploy/kcl/dev/main.k computes
// `_namespace = option("namespace") or identity.namespace(option("worktree"))`,
// so a render that omits `worktree=` resolves to the unsuffixed namespace
// while the deploy that applied the objects resolved to the suffixed one.
//
// That is exactly the defect this centralization removes. `forge env deploy`
// (internal/cluster.renderDArgs) and `forge env up`'s entity render
// (internal/cli.renderKCLRaw) both passed these bindings; the doctor's
// cluster-health render (internal/doctor.renderEnvForCluster) did not. So
// `forge env status dev` listed pods in `control-plane-dev`, found none —
// they were all in `control-plane-dev-<worktree>`, running — and reported
// four healthy workloads as "NO PODS", failing the check and the `forge env
// up` exit code with it.
//
// Applying it here rather than at each caller is what makes the omission
// unrepresentable: there is one place a render can be constructed, so a

//
// kpm's client.WithWorkDir decides where kpm resolves the PACKAGE from. It does
// NOT reach `file.read`, which the KCL runtime resolves against the real
// process cwd — so a project whose KCL reads a file by project-relative path
// (control-plane's deploy/kcl/lib/barman_plugin.k does
// `file.read("deploy/cnpg/plugin-barman-cloud.yaml")`) renders correctly only
// when forge was invoked from the project root, and fails with "No such file or
// directory" naming a path that plainly exists from anywhere else.
//
// # Why it is OPT-IN rather than the default
//
// Because os.Chdir is process-global, and this package is a library. The chdir
// sits inside the KCL evaluation lock, so no two evaluations can race each
// other — but nothing stops UNRELATED code in the same process from resolving
// its own relative path while an evaluation holds that lock. That is not
// hypothetical: making it unconditional turned
// internal/templates.TestBornContractTestSurvivesDepValidation intermittently
// red, because it computes the forge module root as
// filepath.Abs(filepath.Join("..", "..")) in a t.Parallel() subtest and
// resolved it against a render's workDir instead. A flaky suite is a worse
// defect than the one being fixed, and forge's own root.go names this hazard
// as the reason `--project-dir` exists at all.
//
// So a CLI command — one process, one evaluation, no concurrent readers —
// opts in, and the shared render paths stay byte-identical. `forge env render`
// therefore still has the `-C` defect described above; fixing it needs kcl-go
