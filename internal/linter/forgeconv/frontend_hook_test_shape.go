//
// The forgeconv-frontend-hook-test-shape analyzer catches a scaffolded hook
// test whose assertions contradict the hook it exercises: a query-shaped
// test (await isSuccess) against a useMutation hook, or a mutation-shaped
// test (mutateAsync) against a useQuery hook. Either one can NEVER pass.
//
// Why this can happen at all, when one classification feeds both files.
// generateFrontendHooks computes the query/mutation split once — the name
// heuristic in codegen.isQueryMethod, then the `// forge:mutation` override
// — and renders BOTH the hooks file and its starter test from that single
// decision. The two therefore agree the moment they are written.
//
// They are pinned together in TIME, not in structure. The hooks file is
// Tier-1: rewritten on every `forge generate`, and gitignored in the
// default scaffold. The test is scaffold-once: written when absent and
// never overwritten, because it becomes the user's file the moment it
// lands. So when the classification for an RPC CHANGES, the hook moves and
// the test does not:
//
//   - forge sharpens the heuristic. Matching query prefixes as characters
//     rather than whole words read "Is" out of IssueMyReliantAPIKey and
//     generated a useQuery for a key-minting write. Fixing that flipped the
//     hook to useMutation and left every already-scaffolded test asserting
//     isSuccess on a mutation that nothing fires.
//   - an author adds `// forge:mutation` to an RPC the heuristic read as a
//     query. Same flip, same frozen test.
//
// Neither case is a template bug, and neither is reachable by making the
// emitters share a classifier — they already do. The gap is that nothing
// NOTICES the frozen half. `forge generate` writes the hook and skips the
// test in silence; the existing forgeconv-frontend-hook-tests rule only
// asks whether a test EXISTS, not whether it can pass. So a project can
// carry a permanently red test that no forge command mentions, which is how
// two of them reached a dogfood branch.
//
// This rule closes that gap by comparing the two files that already exist,
// with no proto parse and no classification of its own: it reads which
// factory each hook was built with and which idiom the test uses on it.
// Reading the ARTIFACTS rather than re-deriving the answer is deliberate —
// a second classifier here would be a third opinion that could itself drift.
//
// Severity is error, not warning: unlike a missing test (a gap in coverage),
// a drifted test is a red suite. It is scoped to the starter's two idioms,
// so a hand-written test that asserts something else is never second-guessed.
