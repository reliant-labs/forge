// Package scaffolds — `forge lint --check-workarounds` rule.
//
// Detects the canonical cross-lane workarounds that shipped to cpnext
// during the v0.2 rebuild (see FORGE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md §2 "Inline
// workarounds shipped in cpnext"). These are ad-hoc patterns that
// compile and ship clean but are real anti-patterns: they paper over a
// missing forge primitive rather than wait for it. Surfacing them as
// warnings turns the catch-bar from "will the next reviewer notice?"
// into "lint flags it before merge."
//
// All findings are SeverityWarning, not error — some workarounds are
// legitimate in some projects (a project might genuinely want a
// `cmd/maintenance.go` cli tool that's not modeled in forge.yaml). The
// warning includes a "should be:" pointer so the reader knows the
// canonical replacement.
//
// A "should be:" pointer written in the FUTURE TENSE is a liability once
// the primitive it waits on ships: it reads as an open gap, and an open
// gap is the standing justification for keeping the fork alive. Rule 1
// below sat stale for a month after its gap closed and was cited as
// live evidence in an ownership audit. When a primitive lands, the
// message it obsoletes has to move with it.
//
// Two rules today, each tracking a workaround actually shipped to
// cpnext:
//
//  1. `testingExtras` — flags `pkg/app/testing_extras.go` files, the
//     hand-rolled stub-repo workaround for the "scaffold-test factory
//     doesn't fill required Deps" gap (FORGE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md §2.2).
//     That gap is CLOSED: `computeAutoStubs` (internal/codegen/
//     bootstrap_gen.go) synthesizes a stub for every interface-typed
//     Deps field — bare identifiers and cross-package selectors alike —
//     and `bootstrap_testing.go.tmpl` emits them. The rule is therefore
//     sharper than when it was written, not obsolete: the file it flags
//     no longer has a gap to justify it, so the finding is now "delete
//     this", not "wait for the fix". Only unresolvable selectors still
//     need hand-rolling, and those are named individually by a TODO in
//     NewTest<Svc> rather than carried in a wholesale bridge file.
//
//  2. `cmdNotInBinaries` — flags `cmd/<name>.go` files that aren't
//     declared in `forge.yaml`'s `binaries:` block. Today every
//     non-server second binary is hand-written (cpnext's
//     `cmd/workspace_proxy.go` is 270 LOC of cobra/k8s/signal-handling
//     boilerplate). R5-2's `forge scaffold binary` command makes the
//     declaration explicit.
//
// Wiring: `runCheckWorkaroundsLint` invokes `LintWorkaroundsRoot` from
// the project root; `lint.go` registers the `--check-workarounds` flag
// and includes the rule in the default `forge lint` run.
