// File: internal/linter/suppress/rules.go
//
// The repo-wide half of suppression: the `lint.rules` map in forge.yaml.
//
// This is the coarsest of the three levels and the one to reach for
// last. It exists because some rules genuinely do not apply to a whole
// project — a CLI has no handlers, an operator has no frontend — and
// making those projects annotate every file would be worse than letting
// them say so once.
//
// The severity vocabulary is `off` / `warn` / `error`, matching
// FrontendLintConfig's existing dial (lint.frontend.typecheck,
// no_important, no_inline_styles) rather than inventing a second
// spelling for the same idea. A rule set to `warn` still reports; it
// just stops gating. That middle setting is the important one: it is
// what lets a project adopt a new opinionated rule incrementally
// instead of choosing between "fails the build today" and "off".

// forge:exclude-contract
// suppress is a pure data/policy package: RuleSeverities is a
// `map[string]string` read from forge.yaml, and Override/ApplyAll are
// methods ON that map value, not behavior behind an injectable seam.
// There is no constructor, no dependency and nothing to fake — a caller
// that wants different behavior passes a different map. A contract.go
// here would be an interface over a map literal.

// the safe direction to fail: the alternative (treating unknown keys as
