// Package suppress is the single suppression mechanism shared by every
// forge-owned linter (forgeconv, scaffolds, migrationlint, and the
// deadcode/vacuous guards once they are exposed to user projects).
//
// # WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS ONE PACKAGE
//
// Every linter forge ships needs the same three escape hatches — turn a
// rule off for the repo, for a file, or for a line — and before this
// package there was exactly one: `contracts.exclude` in forge.yaml, a
// path-glob list that only the contract linter honored. A rule with no
// way to say "not here, and here is why" is a rule authors route around
// by deleting the check, not by narrowing it.
//
// The three levels are deliberately NOT interchangeable, and the reason
// is the same one the golangci template gives for preferring //nolint
// over a path glob: a glob silently swallows every FUTURE finding under
// that path, including the one you would have wanted to see. So the
// levels narrow as they get more local, and the most local one is the
// one meant to be reached for:
//
//	forge.yaml lint.rules   whole repo, per rule, off|warn|error
//	file directive          one file, per rule
//	line directive          one line, per rule   ← prefer this
//
// PIGGYBACKING ON //nolint
//
// Go authors already have muscle memory for `//nolint:name`, and a
// forge rule that demanded its own spelling for the same job would be
// one more thing to remember for no benefit. So `//nolint:<rule>` is
// honored for forge rules too, with golangci's own positional
// semantics (trailing on a code line = that line; alone on a line =
// the line below).
//
// This is safe in both directions. golangci-lint ignores unknown names
// in a nolint list, so `//nolint:forgeconv-list-filter-optional` does
// not make golangci complain — UNLESS the project enables `nolintlint`,
// which flags nolint directives naming linters it does not know. That
// is the one configuration where the forge spelling is the better
// choice, which is why both exist rather than only the borrowed one.
//
// The forge-native spelling is `forge:lint-disable...`, matching the
// ~25 other `forge:*` directives the toolchain already reads
// (forge:optional-dep, forge:read-only, forge:exclude-contract, …).
//
// # COMMENT SYNTAX IS NOT PARSED, ON PURPOSE
//
// Directives are found by scanning each line for the directive token,
// not by parsing comments. forge lints Go, proto, SQL, TypeScript and
// YAML — five comment syntaxes (`//`, `--`, `#`) — and a per-language
// comment parser here would be five parsers to keep correct for a
// feature whose entire job is finding a keyword. The cost of the
// shortcut is that a directive token inside a string literal would be
// honored; the benefit is that one scanner serves every linter forge
// will ever add. Given the token is `forge:lint-disable`, a false hit
// is a curiosity, not a hazard.
//
// # REASONS
//
// A suppression of an error-severity rule must carry a reason (`: why`
// after the rule list). This is not ceremony. The audience for forge's
// opinionated rules is authors who do not yet know why the rule exists,
// and the moment they suppress one is exactly the moment they either
// learn it or route around it. A reason turns the suppression into a
// decision a reviewer can evaluate; without one it is a shrug that
// reads identically to giving up. Warning-severity rules do not
// require one — they do not gate, so silencing them is cheap by design.
