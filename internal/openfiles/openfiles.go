// Package openfiles answers the one question every reclaimer that deletes from
// a shared directory must ask first: is a live process using this path?
//
// Three reclaimers ask it — the temp sweep, source-cache eviction and worktree
// removal — and each had its own lsof parser, which went wrong in the same
// three ways:
//
//   - PATH SPELLING. lsof reports the path the kernel resolved, so on macOS a
//     file under os.TempDir() (/var/folders/…) is reported as
//     /private/var/folders/…. A string comparison against the unresolved form
//     matched 2 of 266 open files under $TMPDIR on one Mac: the in-use check
//     was off and nothing said so. Snapshot compares canonical paths on BOTH
//     sides.
//   - PARTIAL SNAPSHOTS. A timed-out or killed lsof has already written part of
//     its listing. Treating that prefix as the whole machine reports every
//     process it never reached as idle. Take accepts only a listing lsof
//     finished: exit 0, or lsof's routine exit 1 for an inaccessible process.
//   - NO TIMEOUT. One caller ran lsof unbounded, so a wedged lsof hung
//     `forge env up`. Take always runs under Timeout.
//
// Every failure is an error, and every caller treats an error as "everything
// is in use". Without the snapshot, age is the only evidence left, and age
// cannot tell abandoned from merely quiet.
//
//forge:exclude-contract: a value type and the function that takes it; consumers inject a func(string) bool predicate, so there is no seam for a contract to describe
