// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE TABLE
//
// One entry per feature that has been REMOVED from forge. Recording a new
// removal is exactly one new `removal` entry — name it, list the patterns that
// constitute a reference to it, and (only if a legitimate look-alike exists)
// add a narrow allowance with the reason spelled out.
//
// Rules for writing an entry:
//
//   - Patterns should be IDENTIFIER-shaped, not English-prose-shaped. Prose is
//     unbounded ("a test asserting the dev-auth bypass is gone" legitimately
//     names it); identifiers are the thing that actually compiles, ships and
//     misleads.
//   - Allowances are suppressed SPANS, not suppressed files: a finding is
//     excused only when the exact text that matched sits inside a match of the
//     allowance's Token. A file-wide allowance (nil Token) needs a very good
//     reason, and Paths to keep it contained.
//   - A too-permissive allowance silently defeats the guard. If an allowance
//     needs more than a sentence to justify, the pattern is probably wrong.
