//
// The one property that subsumes a whole class of birth defects:
//
//	FORGE'S GENERATED DATA MUST SATISFY FORGE'S GENERATED SCHEMA.
//
// forge emits both halves of a new entity — the CREATE TABLE (this
// package) and the rows that fill it (pkg/seedplan, via `forge db
// seed` and `forge run`'s auto-seed). Nothing checked that the two agree.
// A measured real-workflow run spent roughly a third of its scaffold
// budget repairing forge's own output before it could start work: born
// fixtures that violated the CHECK constraint sitting in the migration
// beside them, and an auto-seed that died outright because it generates
// every column independently and so cannot satisfy a constraint that
// spans two of them.
//
// Grepping the emitted SQL would not have caught any of it — every
// individual statement was well-formed. Only BUILDING it does: render the
// migrations, apply them to a real postgres, run the real seeder against
// the applied schema, and require every planned row to land. A row that
// violates its own table's constraints cannot survive that, whatever
// spelling the violation takes (CHECK, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, FK), and neither
// can a future regression in a shape nobody has thought of yet.
//
// The corpus is the shapes that actually broke, kept deliberately small
// and generic — an optional foreign key, a two-column ordering CHECK, a
// UNIQUE column, a date-only column, an enum with a proto zero sentinel,
// a bool, a numeric bound. It is a SHAPE corpus, not a domain: a project
// with one entity, forty entities, or no frontend at all exercises the
// same emitter through the same path.
//
// The migrations are BUILT, never hand-written: hand-written SQL would
// test the fixture instead of forge. What the corpus does add by hand is
// the `authored` half — the constraints a real owner adds AFTER birth. The
// birth migration is user-owned from its first byte (see the file header
// of entityproto.go), and forge's own suggestion machinery tells authors to
// add indexes and constraints in migrations they own. The seeder therefore
// has to satisfy the APPLIED schema, not just the part forge typed.
