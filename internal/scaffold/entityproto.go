// The proto→schema birth affordance behind
// `forge scaffold entity <name> --from-proto <svc>[.<Message>]`:
// render the create-table migration pair for an entity whose wire
// message is ALREADY authored in the service proto (read from the
// compiled descriptor). This is a one-time convenience at birth — the
// emitted migration is USER-OWNED the moment it is written, and forge
// never re-reads the proto to regenerate or edit it. Evolution is a new
// migration plus a proto edit; the two truths evolve on independent
// clocks ("the line is the filesystem", docs/design/VERTICAL_SCAFFOLDING.md §6).

// caller did not set this field". That is a fact about a REQUEST. It is
// never a fact about a stored row, and a column that admits it admits a
// value the domain does not have, which every reader then has to handle.
// Real-workflow run 1 is the evidence — all four born migrations were
// hand-edited off the sentinel, four times out of four, by agents who
// were not asked to.
//
// forge treats the sentinel as not-a-value everywhere else it touches
// one: the seeder refuses to draw it (seedplan.SeedEnumChoices), the born
// CRUD fixtures refuse to use it (codegen.enumFixture), the scaffolded
// create form refuses to submit it, and the generated write path stores
// the column DEFAULT instead of it (codegen.assignToDB). A CHECK that
// admitted it was forge contradicting itself in the same statement as the
// comment that says so.
//
// Two boundaries the rule does NOT cross:
//
//   - Only the member at NUMBER ZERO carries the no-presence meaning, so
//     only the leading member is dropped. A member named `*_UNKNOWN`
//     declared at 3 is somebody's real "we asked and nobody knew"; the
//     seeder's name filter is right to skip drawing it and this would be
//     wrong to delete it.
//   - An enum whose zero member is NOT named as a sentinel has no
//     spelling for "unset" at all, and an enum that is ONLY its sentinel
//     has no real member to fall back to. Both keep the full vocabulary —
//     `CHECK (col IN ())` is not applyable SQL, and deleting a domain
