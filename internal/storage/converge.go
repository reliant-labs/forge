// used: the project it ran in, the k3d contexts the env declares, the local
// registry container those contexts pull from, that registry's host aliases,
// the repositories this build pushes, and the project's release pins.
//
// Every field is optional. Converge records what it is given and leaves the
// rest of the policy alone — a cluster phase knows contexts and aliases but no
// repositories, a build knows all five. That is why activation does not need a
// command of its own: the facts arrive from whichever touch point happens to
// run, and accumulate.

	// Contexts are kubectl contexts whose workloads protect images in the
	// registry. Only local `k3d-` contexts are accepted: retention reads the
	// protected set from them, and a remote cluster forge cannot list would
	// make deletion unsafe.
	Contexts []string
	// Registry is the local registry's CONTAINER name (`k3d-…`), which is
	// also how `forge storage gc` addresses it.
	Registry string
	// Aliases are every host name under which that one registry is pushed to
	// or pulled from — the containerd mirror keys plus the in-network
	// `<container>:5000`. A repository is attributed to this registry only
	// when its host is one of these.
	Aliases []string
	// Repositories are full image references, registry host included. The
	// host is matched against Aliases and then stripped: retention works in
	// repository paths, as the registry API does.
	Repositories []string
	// Pins are image digests that must survive retention regardless of age.
	Pins []string
	// Repos are git repositories (any path inside one) whose worktrees the
	// worktree layer may reclaim: the project's own and its build siblings.

// Converge upserts Facts into the machine storage policy, under the same lock
// every other policy writer takes.
//
// Three properties make this safe to call from a hot path, on every run:
//
//   - IDEMPOTENT. Converging the same facts twice leaves the file untouched
//     (it is not even rewritten), so warm runs cost one read.
//   - ADDITIVE ONLY. Nothing is ever removed here. Several projects on one
//     machine converge into the same policy, and a project that stops using a
//     context must not silently un-protect it for everybody else. Entries that
//     are GONE — a cluster no longer in kubeconfig or docker, a deleted
//     project directory — are removed by Prune at the start of GC, never here.
//     A project under the temp dir is never added at all.
//   - COMPLETE-OR-NOTHING for a registry. A registry becomes a cleanup target
//     only once the container, its aliases, the protecting contexts and at
//     least one repository are all known. Recording a registry whose
//     protecting contexts were still unknown would authorize deletion against
//     an unknown protected set, which is the one failure mode retention must
//     never have. Partial facts still converge their project/context/pin half.
