// SourceCacheRoot overrides the cross-repo source cache this Runner
// maintains. Empty means the real machine-local cache
// (<UserCacheDir>/forge/sources), which is what production wants.
//
// It exists because this layer is the only one in GC that reclaims from a
// fixed ABSOLUTE path outside the project: Logs walks Policy.Projects
// (empty by default, so inert), and the registry layers go through an
// injected Command. A test that merely wanted to assert "GC rejects a
// remote Docker endpoint" would otherwise delete a developer's real
// clones as a side effect — which it did, once, before this field
// existed. A reclaimer whose blast radius is not addressable from the
// test that calls it is a reclaimer that will eventually be run by
// accident.
// Under `go test` an unset root is REFUSED rather than defaulted. Opting
// out by remembering to set a field is not a safeguard — the four tests
// that deleted real clones were asserting things about Docker endpoints
// and had no reason to think about a source cache at all. Making the
// default unreachable from a test turns "remember this" into a compile-
// time-adjacent failure with a message that says what to set.

// Sources reclaims cross-repo source clones that no project has resolved
// recently. One full clone exists per repo+ref pin and nothing else ever
// removes one, so a project that bumps its pin weekly accumulates a
// complete checkout per bump — 9.2 GB of one repository on the machine
// this layer was written for, most of it an installed node_modules.
//
// The eviction MECHANISM and its safety rules live in internal/gitsource,
// next to the code that writes the cache; the BUDGETS come from this
// machine's storage policy, the way every other layer's do, so a developer
// tunes one file rather than learning where each reclaimer hides its
// defaults. The newest-K floor means an idle project's current pin
// survives, so this is safe to run unattended.
//
// An unparseable SourceCacheUnused cannot happen on a loaded policy —
// Validate rejects it and GC calls Validate first — so it is treated the
// same as an unset value: the gitsource default, never "evict everything".
//
// A cache that cannot be located is not a failure: os.UserCacheDir fails
// on a host with no HOME, where there is also nothing to reclaim.
