// agent_memory_starter_code_test.go — keeps the "the scaffolded UI is
// starter code" note in the channels an agent actually reads.
//
// The note exists because of a specific, repeatable failure: forge prints
// it at the end of `forge project new`, and agents routinely run that
// command with stdout redirected to /dev/null. The guidance is then never
// read by anyone, the agent treats forge's entity-tile dashboard and
// generated CRUD pages as finished product work, and that is what ships.
//
// stdout is a broadcast nobody is required to receive. The project memory
// file is the durable channel: it is auto-loaded into EVERY agent session
// for the scaffolded project, so a note there is read whether or not the
// scaffold's output survived. That is why this guard is on the TEMPLATE
// and not on the printed block — the printed line is a courtesy, the file
// is the contract.
//
// Same philosophy as frontend_design_contract_test.go: a rule the scaffold
// states and then breaks is worse than no rule. Here the failure mode is
// quieter — a rule the scaffold never states at all, in the one file
// guaranteed to be read.
