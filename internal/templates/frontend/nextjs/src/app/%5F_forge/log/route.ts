// yours: scaffolded once, never touched again — forge will not overwrite this file
//
// Dev-server half of browser log forwarding (Next.js).
//
// The Vite scaffold does this with a `apply: "serve"` plugin; the App Router
// has no equivalent hook, so the receiver is an ordinary route handler that
// refuses to do anything in production.
//
// Why the folder is spelled `%5F_forge`: the App Router treats any folder
// whose name starts with `_` as PRIVATE — excluded from routing — so a
// literal `src/app/__forge/log/route.ts` compiles cleanly and then answers
// 404 to every post, silently dropping every browser line. `%5F` is the
// URL-encoded underscore, which is Next's documented escape for a URL
// segment that must begin with one: this folder serves `/__forge/log`,
// the path installDevLogging() posts to.
//
// It accepts the log lines that @reliantlabs/forge-web-runtime's
// installDevLogging() posts and prints them to the dev server's stdout, where
// `forge env up` is already tee-ing them to:
//
//   .forge/logs/<env>/frontend_<name>.log
//
// So a `console.error` in a component — and any uncaught error or unhandled
// rejection, which produce no console call at all — lands in a file on disk
// next to the backend service logs.
//
// ── The wire protocol ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// v2 (current) posts a BATCH, because one request per console line saturated
// the browser's six-connections-per-origin pool and measurably slowed the app's
// own RPCs:
//
//   {"entries":[{"level":"info","msg":"…"},{"level":"error","msg":"…"}]}
//
// v1 (legacy) posts one line per request, and is accepted forever — an older
// runtime in some other frontend, or a cached bundle, still speaks it:
//
//   {"level":"info","msg":"…"}
//
// Two details that look incidental and are not:
//
//   - The body is read as TEXT and parsed by hand, not via request.json().
//     The client's unload flush uses navigator.sendBeacon, which can only send
//     text/plain without triggering a CORS preflight it is unable to make;
//     request.json() is fine with that today but the contract is "parse
//     regardless of Content-Type", so the parse is explicit.
//   - Every accepted post answers `X-Forge-Devlog: 2`. That header is how the
//     client learns this endpoint understands batches; without it, it falls
//     back to one request per line.
//
// A malformed or oversized post prints a warn line rather than being swallowed.
// A silent drop here is indistinguishable from "my code never ran", which is
// the single most expensive way for a log sink to fail.
//
// The production guard is the first statement in the handler: `next build`
// still compiles this route, so unlike the Vite plugin it CAN exist in a
// deployed app, and must answer 404 there. installDevLogging() also no-ops in
// production, so nothing posts to it in the first place.
//
// To turn it off: delete this file and the installDevLogging() call in
// src/app/providers.tsx. Nothing else depends on it.
