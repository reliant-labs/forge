// Every package @reliantlabs/forge-web-runtime declares as a peer must resolve to
// ONE copy — this app's.
//
// peerDependencies states the contract ("the consuming app supplies this
// copy"), and npm honours it for a registry install by hoisting a single copy
// to the app root. It CANNOT honour it for the `file:` specifier a dev build
// of forge writes to bridge a local checkout: that is materialised as a
// symlink, the checkout behind it carries its own node_modules, and a bundler
// resolves a module's bare imports by walking up from that module's own
// location. So the runtime binds React and React Query out of the forge
// checkout while this app binds its own — two copies, each with its own
// module-scope state and its own React context.
//
// That breaks precisely the hooks: every generated `use<Rpc>` runs inside the
// runtime's service-hooks factory, so it would read a React Query context the
// test's own <QueryClientProvider> never wrote to —
// "TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')".
//
// Reading the list from the package rather than hard-coding it means a peer
// added to the runtime later is deduped here without anyone remembering to
// update this file. Same mechanism the vite-spa scaffold uses.
// Walk up to find the package. An npm workspace — which forge's own dev bridge
// writes — HOISTS every member's dependencies to the workspace root, so this
// frontend legitimately has no node_modules of its own and the package sits at
// the project root instead. Reading only __dirname/node_modules threw
// `ENOENT: no such file or directory` and took the whole vitest run down at
// config load, before a single test ran.
