// ── Accessibility (jsx-a11y) ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// EXTRACTION SEAM — read this before adding a rule here.
//
// `a11yRules` is a NAMED BASE, spread into the rules object below; anything
// declared after the spread overrides it. That shape is deliberate, because
// this file is scaffold-once: forge writes it when the frontend is created
// and never again — it is not in generator.managedFiles(), so
// `forge project upgrade` does not refresh it either. Rules inlined here are
// frozen for the life of the project, so a rule forge later fixes, or a newly
// useful one, never reaches an app that already exists.
//
// The answer to that is a published eslint config package both scaffolds
// import, so `npm update` carries rule changes into existing projects; that
// is a release-surface decision and is not taken here. Until it is, the move
// must stay MECHANICAL: replace `const a11yRules = {…}` with an import of the
// package's base and change nothing else. Two things keep it that way —
// TestBothESLintConfigsShareOneA11yBlock fails if the Next.js and Vite copies
// drift, and per-project deviations belong AFTER the spread, never inside it.
//
// Do not split this into a forge-generated eslint fragment in the meantime.
// It would buy only "no npm publish", at the price of a config mechanism
// nothing else in the ecosystem has — and it would have to be unwound when
// the package lands.
//
// Calibrated the way internal/templates/project/golangci.yml is: a rule
// earns its place by finding a BROKEN CONTROL — one with no accessible
// name, no keyboard path, or a role that lies about what it is. A rule that
// fires on idiomatic React is not finding bugs, it is teaching you to skim
// past lint output. Every rule below is silent on the code forge itself
// scaffolds; the ones that were not are listed under "NOT enabled".
//
// ERROR, not warn. `eslint .` exits 0 on warnings, so a warn-level a11y
// rule is a notice, not a gate — and a control a screen-reader user cannot
// name is a defect, not a preference.
//
// This block is byte-identical to the one in the Next.js scaffold's
// eslint.config.mjs, and that matters: the component library at
// src/components/ui/**, and everything under shared-web/, ships the SAME
// BYTES into both trees. A rule enabled in one config and not the other
// makes the same file clean in one frontend and red in the other.

  // correctly-labelled control exactly as loudly as the unlabelled one.

  // ── NOT enabled, and why ──
  //
  // click-events-have-key-events — the only rule in this family that
  //   ignores the explicit `role`, so it cannot see keyboard handling that
  //   lives on a composite widget's CONTAINER. It fires on every ARIA APG
  //   listbox (`<li role="option" onClick>`), including forge's own
  //   EntityPicker, where arrow-keys and Enter are wired on the search
  //   input via aria-activedescendant and the option rows are correctly
  //   not focusable. Its only repair there is a keydown handler on an
  //   element that can never receive focus — dead code that reads like a
  //   contract. no-static-element-interactions + interactive-supports-focus
  //   above catch the defect it is aimed at. The residue it alone would
  //   have caught: `<div role="button" tabIndex={0} onClick>` with no key
  //   handler — an author who got role and focusability right and stopped
  //   one step short.
  //
  // no-autofocus — autoFocus on a search page or a modal's first field is
  //   a considered product decision, and the rule cannot tell it from a
  //   careless one. A preference, not a bug.
  //
  // prefer-tag-over-role — tells you to swap <select size> in for a
  //   server-paged combobox and <progress> in for a styled bar. It fires
  //   on five correct composite widgets in the scaffold and is right about
  //   none of them.
  //
  // img-redundant-alt / anchor-ambiguous-text — prose review ("image of…",
  //   "click here"). Real advice, but content is not a control, and
  //   anchor-ambiguous-text is off in the plugin's own preset too.
  //
  // media-has-caption — a caption is a FILE, not a code change, so the
  //   only repair available to the author of a decorative muted <video> is
  //   a suppression. That is the shape of rule that trains you to reach
  //   for eslint-disable.
  //
  // no-redundant-roles — <ul role="list"> is redundant, not broken.
