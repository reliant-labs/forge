// frontend_auth_flow_test.go — the scaffolded sign-in flow is NATIVE, and
// these guards keep it that way in both browser frontend kinds.
//
// ── What changed ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Sign-in used to be a browser-side OIDC authorization-code + PKCE flow:
// the browser fetched the discovery document, redirected to the issuer,
// came back to /auth/callback with a code, redeemed it at the token
// endpoint, and held the resulting tokens in JavaScript. Every one of those
// steps is gone.
//
// The browser now POSTs credentials to THIS APP'S OWN API and gets an
// HttpOnly session cookie. The server (internal/app/login_broker.go, over
// pkg/devidp) runs the whole OIDC flow. The browser never contacts the
// identity provider at all.
//
//	sign in  →  POST /auth/login     → cookie set, identity returned
//	sign up  →  POST /auth/register  → cookie set, identity returned
//	who am I →  GET  /auth/session   → identity, never a token
//	sign out →  POST /auth/logout    → cookie cleared
//
// ── Why these are the assertions ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The property that makes this design worth having is a NEGATIVE one — the
// token is unreachable from script — and a negative property is exactly
// what no functional test catches. A scaffold that quietly grew a token
// endpoint call, a client secret, or a localStorage write would still sign
// users in perfectly; it would just have given the XSS back its prize. So
// the headline guard below is a scan for absence, run over the whole
// composed browser tree rather than over a hand-listed file set.
//
// Every assertion derives from the COMPOSED TEMPLATE TREE — the same
// listing the scaffolder writes from — rather than from a hardcoded file
// list, so a file that stops being emitted fails here instead of at a
// user's first login.
