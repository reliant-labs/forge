// golangci-lint's `linters.exclusions.paths` entries are REGEXES matched
// against the file path, not directory names. An unanchored entry therefore
// exempts every path that merely CONTAINS it.
//
// Both configs carried a bare `gen`, intended for the generated proto package
// at the project root. It also matched any package whose path contains those
// three letters — `internal/agent/` most obviously (a-GEN-t), and `legend`,
// `agenda`, `regenerate`, `genome`, plus every file named `*generate*.go`
// anywhere in the tree. Those packages linted green because nothing looked at
// them, which is the worst way to be green.
//
// Measured on forge's own repo: the bare entry excluded 311 of 1177 Go files
// (26.4%) — all of internal/codegen/ and internal/generator/ — and hid 223
// findings. With it anchored, 39 files (3.3%) are excluded.
//
// Two guards, because there are two ways to lose the lint surface:
//
//   - TestGolangciExclusionPathsAreAnchored is SYNTACTIC. It holds the rule
//     for every path entry in BOTH configs, not just the one that was wrong:
//     an entry must be anchored, or scoped by a separator or extension, so it
//     cannot silently widen to a package name.
//   - TestGolangciExclusionsLeaveMostOfTheRepoLinted is EMPIRICAL, and it is
//     the one that matters. A syntactically-anchored entry can still be far
//     too broad (`.*internal.*` is "scoped" and exempts everything). It
//     measures what the exclusions actually remove from forge's own tree and
//     fails if the linted surface shrinks past a stated fraction. It would
//     have caught the bare `gen` by its EFFECT, however it was spelled.

// lintConfigs are the two configs this rule governs. They are deliberately
// not the same file — forge is a CLI/code generator, the template's consumers
// are servers, and their enabled rule sets differ. The ANCHORING rule is
// identical for both.
