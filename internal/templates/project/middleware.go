//go:build ignore

// Package middleware is YOUR authentication policy surface — forge
// scaffolded it once and will not rewrite it.
//
// Authentication is a MIDDLEWARE: it validates the bearer token and puts
// *Claims on the context. It runs FAIL-CLOSED — a request with no token, or
// an invalid one, is rejected before any handler runs, unless the RPC it
// names declared `auth_required: false` in the proto.
//
// That is authentication and nothing more. Deciding what a caller may DO,
// and WHICH ROWS they may see, is HANDLER LOGIC you write — call GetUser
// below to resolve the caller and add the checks and query filters your
// product needs. No annotation can express those.
//
// The middleware MECHANISMS (auth interceptor modes + refusal-to-start,
// CORS, security headers, request-id, rate limiting, idempotency, the HTTP
// stack, recovery/logging) live in the forge libraries —
// github.com/reliant-labs/forge/pkg/{authn,middleware,observe} — versioned
// with forge so they keep receiving fixes. That includes the claims stash
// and GetUser, which this file re-exports as one-line delegations: they
// were identical in every project, so they are library code wearing your
// package's name.
//
// This file wires the POLICY: the two things projects actually customize.
//
//  1. Token validator  — passed EXPLICITLY into NewAuthInterceptor via
//     AuthDeps.Validate (no package-global slot). The OWNED composition
//     root internal/app/auth.go (SetupAuth) builds the validator and the
//     generated cmd serve.go threads it in.
//  2. Identity enricher — enrichClaims (hydrate roles/org/flags onto
//     validated claims before handlers see them).
//
// The allow-list is NOT a hook here: which RPCs are callable without
// credentials is declared per-rpc in the proto (auth_required: false) and
// projected into procedures_gen.go. See the note above UnauthenticatedProcedures.

// ─── Claims: the library's stash, re-exported ───────────────────────
//
// The type, the context key, the accessors and GetUser are MECHANISM and
// live in forge/pkg/authn. They are re-exported here as aliases and
// one-line delegations so generated handlers and your own code keep
// spelling middleware.Claims / middleware.GetUser: the names are stable,
// the implementation is versioned with forge.
//
// These are not hooks. Change authentication POLICY below (the validator
// and enrichClaims), not here.

// Claims is the canonical claims type used throughout the application.
//
// To extend Claims with project-specific fields, hydrate the existing
// fields via enrichClaims below.
type Claims = authn.Claims

// ClaimsFromContext retrieves user claims from the context. Returns
// nil, false if no claims are present (e.g. unauthenticated request).
func ClaimsFromContext(ctx context.Context) (*Claims, bool) { return authn.ClaimsFromContext(ctx) }

// ContextWithClaims returns a new context with the given claims attached.
func ContextWithClaims(ctx context.Context, claims *Claims) context.Context {
	return authn.ContextWithClaims(ctx, claims)
}

// GetUser extracts the authenticated user's claims from the context.
// Returns a connect CodeUnauthenticated error if no claims are present.
// Use this in handlers to get the current user before enforcing your own
// access-control rules — forge generates no access control.
func GetUser(ctx context.Context) (*Claims, error) { return authn.GetUser(ctx) }

// ─── The unauthenticated allow-list is DECLARED IN THE PROTO ─────────
//
// Which RPCs a caller may reach with no credentials is
// `(forge.v1.method).auth_required = false` on the rpc, and nothing else.
// forge projects those declarations into UnauthenticatedProcedures
// (procedures_gen.go, regenerated every run) and the interceptor reads it.
//
// This file used to carry a second, hand-written copy of that set. Two
// declaration surfaces for one fact can disagree, and only one of them was
// load-bearing: an RPC could declare auth_required: true, appear as
// authenticated in `forge project graph`, and still
// serve anonymous callers because the map said so and the annotation said
// nothing to the runtime. Publishing an endpoint is now one edit, in the file
// that declares the endpoint.
//
// ─── Policy hook 1: the token validator (explicit, no global) ─────────

// AuthDeps carries the EXPLICIT authentication policy into the
// interceptor. The composition root builds an AuthDeps once and threads it
// into NewAuthInterceptor, so there is no process-wide mutable slot the
// per-request hot path reads.
type AuthDeps struct {
	// ExternalAuth reports that another interceptor in the chain owns auth
	// (a pack, or a header-carried provider). The interceptor then becomes
	// a pure passthrough so the external interceptor is the source of truth.
	ExternalAuth bool

	// AnonymousOK makes authentication NON-GATING: a request with NO
	// Authorization header proceeds claim-less, and every handler is then
	// responsible for demanding a principal itself.
	//
	// The generated serve wiring sets it FALSE — a request must present a
	// valid token unless the RPC it names declared auth_required: false. The
	// non-gating posture is what let one measured app serve seventeen of its
	// twenty CRUD RPCs to anonymous callers while every one of those RPCs
	// declared auth_required: true, because "handlers enforce it themselves"
	// is a rule nothing checks and every handler has to remember.
	//
	// Set it true only if some other interceptor in the chain establishes
	// identity, or if this service genuinely authenticates nothing.
	AnonymousOK bool

	// Validate validates a raw bearer token and returns the claims. Non-nil
	// switches the interceptor into validate mode; nil leaves ExternalAuth
	// as the only remaining signal and otherwise refuses to start (a
	// production server with no auth provider is a bug).
	Validate func(token string) (*Claims, error)
}

// ─── Policy hook 2: identity enrichment ──────────────────────────────
//
// enrichClaims runs after token validation and before the claims are
// stashed on the context. Hydrate identity here — roles from the user
// table, org membership, feature flags. Returning an error rejects the
// request (CodeUnauthenticated unless you return a *connect.Error).
//
// The default is the identity function.
func enrichClaims(_ context.Context, claims *Claims) (*Claims, error) {
	return claims, nil
}

// ─── Interceptor construction ────────────────────────────────────────

// NewAuthInterceptor resolves this file's policy into the forge authn
// interceptor from an EXPLICIT AuthDeps (no package globals).
//
// Mode resolution (see forge/pkg/authn for details): a server with NO
// validator (deps.Validate == nil) and NO external auth REFUSES TO START —
// cmd serve.go returns the error before the listener binds. A production
// server with no auth provider is always a bug; refusing to start is safer
// than silently accepting (or silently rejecting) every request.
//
// Running without authentication is a decision you make HERE, in code, by
// setting ExternalAuth (or by handing back a validator that accepts what you
// intend). There is no environment variable that does it: an opt-out
// settable from any shell cannot be reviewed, does not appear in this
// project's config, and makes "this server authenticates" impossible to
// prove from the source.
func NewAuthInterceptor(deps AuthDeps) (connect.Interceptor, error) {
	return authn.NewInterceptor(authn.Policy{
		ValidatorConfigured: deps.Validate != nil,
		ExternalAuth:        deps.ExternalAuth,
		AnonymousOK:         deps.AnonymousOK,
		Validate:            deps.Validate,
		Unauthenticated:     UnauthenticatedProcedures,
		Enrich:              enrichClaims,
	})
