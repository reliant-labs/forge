# Audit + Map JSON Output

Machine-readable counterparts to the human-formatted `forge project audit` /
`forge project map` (same data, ANSI colours + tree characters). Use JSON for CI
gates, dashboards, sub-agent introspection, scripted audits. New finding types are
added additively — existing keys never change shape.

- **`forge project audit --json`** — per-category roll-up of project health:
  forge version pin, project shape, lint status, codegen drift, migration
  safety, scaffold markers, deps. One JSON object per run.
- **`forge project map --json`** — annotated project tree: every file labelled
  user-owned, forge-space (regenerated), scaffold-with-markers, or
  drifted (forge-space file with hand-edits). One nested-tree JSON
  object per run.

## `forge project audit --json` shape

```jsonc
{
  "project_name": "myproject",
  "project_kind": "service",
  "binary_version": "0.7.2",
  "generated_at": "2026-05-07T15:06:12.407Z",
  "categories": {
    "version": { "status": "ok",   "summary": "...", "details": { ... } },
    "shape":   { "status": "ok",   "summary": "...", "details": { ... } },
    "conventions": { "status": "warn", "summary": "...", "details": { ... } },
    "codegen": { "status": "warn", "summary": "...", "details": { ... } },
    "file_sizes": { "status": "ok", "summary": "...", "details": { ... } },
    "migration_safety": { "status": "ok", "summary": "...", "details": { ... } },
    "scaffold_markers":  { "status": "ok", "summary": "...", "details": { ... } },
    "unscoped_auth": { "status": "warn", "summary": "...", "details": { ... } },
    "deps":    { "status": "ok",   "summary": "...", "details": { ... } }
  },
  "overall_status": "warn"
}
```

Top-level keys are stable:

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|
| `project_name` | string | `name:` from forge.yaml, or directory basename if no forge.yaml |
| `project_kind` | string | `service`, `cli`, `library`, or `unknown` |
| `binary_version` | string | The forge binary that produced the audit (`dev` for local builds) |
| `generated_at` | RFC3339 timestamp (UTC) | When the audit ran |
| `categories` | object | Per-category roll-ups, keyed by category name |
| `overall_status` | string | `ok` / `warn` / `error` — worst category status wins |

Each category is the same shape:

```jsonc
{
  "status":  "ok" | "warn" | "error",
  "summary": "human-readable one-liner",
  "details": { ... category-specific keys ... }   // optional
}
```

### Category keys

`ingress` appears only under `features.experimental.ingress: true` and
`prerequisites` only for deploy-shaped projects; the rest are always emitted.
Iterate `.categories | keys[]` rather than hard-coding the list.

| Category | What's in `details` (when relevant) |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| `version` | `pinned_version`, `binary_version`, `ci_pin`, `state_pin`, `intentional`, `hint` (when mismatch) |
| `shape` | `services[]`, `frontends[]` (each `{name, type}`), `packages[]`, `proto_integrity` (only when proto parsing failed). Workers and operators are owned code with no proto contract — forge does **not** inventory them. |
| `shape.services[]` | `name`, `type`, `rpc_count`, `rpcs[]` — each rpc is `{name, streaming?}`. `streaming` is omitted for unary RPCs, else `"client"`/`"server"`/`"bidi"`. |
| `features` | `resolved{}` (every feature → bool), `enabled[]`, `disabled[]`, `experimental_enabled[]`, `experimental_available[]`. Informational — always `ok`. |
| `ingress` | `gateways`, `http_routes`, `grpc_routes`, `services_without_route`, `findings[]` |
| `environments` | `environments[]` (each `{name, status}` — one per `deploy/kcl/<env>/main.k`) |
| `external_builds` | `enabled`, `services[]` |
| `prerequisites` | `external_secrets`, `dns_records`, `byte_match_groups`, `undeclared_secret_mounts`, `findings[]` |
| `conventions` | `counts{}` (per-rule violation counts), `hint` |
| `codegen` | `tracked_files` / `certified_files` (same count), `last_generate`, `legacy_manifest`, `user_edited_gen_files[]`, `orphan_gen_files[]`, `disowned_files[]` (`{path, since, reason}`) + `disowned_hint`, and `forked_files[]` (**legacy**: always empty, kept only so a consumer reading the key does not break — see `forked_files_note`) |
| `migration_safety` | `migration_count`, `migrations_dir`, `latest_migration`, `latest_migration_mtime`, `allowed_destructive[]`, `destructive_change_severity`, `hint`. `warn` when `allowed_destructive` is non-empty. |
| `optional_deps_guard` | `finding_count`, `affected_packages[]`, `by_package{}`, `hint` (unguarded derefs of `// forge:optional-dep` Deps fields — warn-level; run `forge lint --optional-deps-guard` for per-line detail) |
| `config_deps` | same rollup shape as `optional_deps_guard` — scalar Deps fields, which wire can never resolve; declare a component config block in `proto/config` instead |
| `scaffold_markers` | `total_markers`, `files[]` (paths still carrying `FORGE_SCAFFOLD:` lines) |
| `crud_stubs` | `files[]`, `total_stubs`, `stubs[]` (`{file, method, reason}`), `marker`, `legacy_marker` — `forge:custom-read-shape` stubs in the user-owned `internal/handlers/<svc>/handlers_crud.go` (the pre-rename `FORGE_CRUD_SHAPE_MISMATCH` marker stays recognized for one release). A stub marks a deliberate non-AIP-158 read shape the user must implement; each stubbed RPC returns `CodeUnimplemented`, so the category is `warn` whenever `total_stubs > 0`. |
| `unscoped_auth` | `authenticated_rpcs`, `scoped_rpcs`, `unscoped_rpcs[]` (`{service, method, file, delegating}`), `acknowledged_rpcs[]` (`{service, method, file, reason}`), `auth_seam`, `acknowledge_marker`, `hint` — RPCs whose proto declares `auth_required: true` but whose handler body never resolves the caller, so every signed-in user reaches every row. The authenticated set is read from `gen/forge_descriptor.json` (the same `auth_required` projection that drives `pkg/middleware/procedures_gen.go`); the reads-the-caller set is the handler AST, matched against the scaffolded auth seam. `warn` whenever `unscoped_rpcs` is non-empty — never `error`, because a fresh scaffold is unscoped by construction and the user writes the scoping. An intentionally global RPC is declared IN CODE above the handler with `// forge:auth-unscoped-ok: <reason>`; the reason is required and is echoed back in `acknowledged_rpcs` for review. If the project declares authenticated RPCs and NO handler matched any of them, the category reports `warn` saying it inspected nothing rather than a vacuous `ok`. |
| `file_sizes` | `line_threshold`, `method_threshold`, `oversized_files[]` (`{path, lines}`), `god_object_types[]` (`{path, type, methods}`), `advisory: true`. **Status is always `ok` — it never gates `overall_status`.** |
| `orphan_stubs` | `orphan_services[]` (`{service, dir, stub_methods[]}` — every handler method still carries `// forge:gen unwired-stub`, so the service serves 501s), `hint`. Fix by implementing the handlers or `forge project delete service <name>`. |
| `deps` | `go_mod`, `go_sum`, `gen_go_mod` presence flags |

### Status semantics

| Status | When |
|--------|------|
| `ok` | Category looks healthy. |
| `warn` | Soft drift — fixable without blocking work. Codegen orphans, unresolved wire fields, unguarded optional-dep derefs, orphan/CRUD stubs, newer-binary version mismatch. |
| `error` | Hard problem — build will fail or behaviour is broken. Missing forge.yaml, error-severity convention violations, unwired scaffolds under strict wiring, undeclared secret mounts. |

`overall_status` is the worst category status. CI gates that block on
`error` (and only `error`) hit the right balance for most projects.

## `forge project map --json` shape

```jsonc
{
  "path": ".",
  "name": "myproject/",
  "is_dir": true,
  "children": [
    {
      "path": "internal/handlers/users/handlers_crud_gen.go",
      "name": "handlers_crud_gen.go",
      "is_dir": false,
      "ownership": "forge-space, hand-edited (drift from regen)",
      "flags": ["drift"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Each `MapNode` carries:

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|
| `path` | string | Path relative to the project root (forward slashes) |
| `name` | string | Display name (trailing `/` for directories) |
| `is_dir` | bool | Directory vs file |
| `ownership` | string (optional) | One of the ownership classes below |
| `flags` | string[] (optional) | Health flags — `drift`, `FORGE_SCAFFOLD`, `diverged-from-migrations` |
| `children` | []MapNode (optional) | Subdirectory contents |

The output is the annotated tree and nothing else — the four keys above are the
whole document.

### Ownership classes

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `user-owned` | Hand-written code; forge never touches it. |
| `forge-space, regenerated` | Tier-1 codegen; rewritten every `forge generate`. |
| `forge-space, hand-edited (drift from regen)` | Tier-1 file whose checksum no longer matches the generator output. Flagged with `drift`. |
| `scaffold, FORGE_SCAFFOLD markers present` | Tier-2 scaffold with at least one `FORGE_SCAFFOLD:` line still present — not yet customised. |

`flags` adds machine-greppable health hints orthogonal to ownership: `drift`
(Tier-1 file with hand-edits), `FORGE_SCAFFOLD` (placeholder markers still
present), and `diverged-from-migrations` (a `proto/db/` entity whose shape
disagrees with the migrations that own the schema).

## Common queries

```bash
# Fail CI on any error-severity category.
forge project audit --json | jq -e '.overall_status == "error" | not' \
  || (echo "forge project audit found errors"; exit 1)

# List every hand-edited generated file.
forge project audit --json | jq -r '.categories.codegen.details.user_edited_gen_files[]?'

# Count Tier-1 files (forge-regenerated).
forge project map --json | jq '[.. | select(.ownership? == "forge-space, regenerated")] | length'

# List every drifted file with its path.
forge project map --json | jq -r '.. | select(.flags? // [] | index("drift")) | .path'

# List every scaffold still carrying FORGE_SCAFFOLD markers.
forge project map --json | jq -r '.. | select(.flags? // [] | index("FORGE_SCAFFOLD")) | .path'

# Project shape: how many services and frontends?
forge project audit --json | jq '.categories.shape.details |
  {services: (.services | length // 0),
   frontends:(.frontends | length // 0)}'

# Which RPCs are streaming, and which are unary?
forge project audit --json | jq -r '.categories.shape.details.services[]?
  | .name as $svc | .rpcs[]?
  | "\($svc).\(.name)\(if .streaming then " (streaming: \(.streaming))" else " (unary)" end)"'

# Version health: is the project's pinned forge version behind the binary in hand?
forge project audit --json | jq -r '.categories.version.details
  | select(.hint) | "\(.pinned_version) -> \(.binary_version): \(.hint)"'

# Convention violations by severity.
forge project audit --json | jq '.categories.conventions.details.counts'

# Orphan _gen files (sources removed, file forgotten).
forge project audit --json | jq -r '.categories.codegen.details.orphan_gen_files[]?'

# Orphan stubs (services whose every handler is still an unwired stub).
forge project audit --json | jq -r '.categories.orphan_stubs.details.orphan_services[]? | .service'

# Monster files / god-object types over threshold (advisory).
forge project audit --json | jq -r '.categories.file_sizes.details |
  (.oversized_files[]?  | "file \(.path): \(.lines) lines"),
  (.god_object_types[]? | "type \(.path) \(.type): \(.methods) methods")'
```

## CI integration

Load the `audit-json/ci-workflow` skill for the drop-in GitHub Actions workflow
(runs both commands, uploads JSON artifacts, fails on `error`, posts a PR summary).

## Sub-agent patterns

Orient before scaffolding (`.categories.shape.details`, `.project_kind`); check
`user_edited_gen_files[]` before regenerating (regen clobbers hand-edits); check
ownership before deleting a directory:

```bash
forge project map --json | jq -r --arg p "internal/handlers/things" \
  '.. | select(.path? == $p) | .ownership'
```

## Extending

The JSON shape is **additive**:

- Existing keys in `categories`, top-level fields, and per-`MapNode` fields keep
  their meaning across forge releases.
- New categories may appear; iterate `.categories | keys[]`, never assume a closed set.
- New `details` keys may appear; `?` every nested lookup so a missing key is `null`,
  not an error.
- New `flags` values and (rarely) new ownership-class strings may appear; treat both
  as open sets and default-treat unknown values.

The status enum (`ok` / `warn` / `error`) and the `status / summary / details`
per-category shape are **frozen**. A new finding type that doesn't fit an existing
category gets a new category (forge issue or PR) — never shoehorn it into an
unrelated one.

## Rules

- `forge project audit --json` for category roll-ups; `forge project map --json` for
  per-file ownership. Both run from the project root (`audit` resolves forge.yaml,
  `map` walks the file tree).
- Gate CI on `overall_status == "error"`; `warn` is informational.
- Pipe through `jq`. Never grep the prose output — it is not a stable interface.

## When this skill is not enough

- **What `forge generate` is doing under the hood** — see
  `architecture`.
- **CI workflow generation** (where the audit workflow plugs in) —
  see `ci`.
- **Tier-1 vs Tier-2 banner classification** — see `architecture`
  ("Three precise classes").
- **Drift remediation** (regenerate vs accept hand-edits) — see
  `migration-upgrade`.
