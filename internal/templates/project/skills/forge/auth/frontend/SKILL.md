# Frontend auth wiring (native sign-in)

**THE BROWSER NEVER CONTACTS THE IDENTITY PROVIDER.** Not `/authorize`, not the discovery document, not the token endpoint, not a hidden iframe. The browser POSTs an email and a password to **this app's own API** and gets back an HttpOnly session cookie. Your server runs all five OIDC steps against the issuer (`internal/app/login_broker.go`, over `forge/pkg/devidp`).

```
browser  ── email + password ──▶  your server ──▶ identity provider
         ◀── HttpOnly cookie ───┘                (the whole OIDC flow)
```

Four endpoints, and that is the entire contract the browser knows about:

| call | endpoint | answers with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sign in | `POST /auth/login` | cookie set, identity returned |
| sign up | `POST /auth/register` | account created **and** signed in, in one call |
| who am I | `GET /auth/session` | the identity, or not-authenticated |
| sign out | `POST /auth/logout` | cookie cleared |

## What the scaffold ships

- **`src/lib/auth/native-login.ts`** — the only file that talks to those four endpoints. It knows nothing about OIDC: no issuer, no client id, no PKCE, no redirect, no token parsing.
- **`src/app/auth/sign-in/page.tsx`** (Next.js) / the `/auth/sign-in` route in `src/routes.tsx` (Vite) — an ordinary form. Deliberately plain starter code; most products restyle sign-in heavily.
- **`src/lib/auth/route-guard.tsx`** — what an anonymous visitor sees. Without it a signed-out visitor gets the full app shell and then a wall of 401s, which looks like a broken app rather than one asking you to sign in.
- **`src/lib/auth/context.tsx`** — `useAuth()`, exposing `{ identity, isAuthenticated, isLoading, refresh, logout }`.
- **`src/components/session_nav.tsx`** — the signed-in-user dropdown with a sign-out.

There is **exactly one auth route**. `/auth/callback` belonged to the browser redirect flow — the issuer sent the browser back there with a code — and with the exchange moved server-side there is nothing for it to do.

## Why the token is not in JavaScript, and what you get instead

The session cookie is **HttpOnly**, so no script can read it. That is the property the design exists for rather than a limitation: **a token no script can reach is a token an XSS cannot steal.** The cookie rides along automatically on same-origin requests, so nothing has to set an `Authorization` header — and `useAuth()` correctly exposes **no `getToken`**. The only honest implementation would return null, and every caller that trusted it would ship broken.

What you get is an **`Identity`**: `{ authenticated, email?, name?, subject? }`. **Presentation only.** Use it to decide what to SHOW (hide an admin tab, render a name). Never to decide what is ALLOWED — the server validates the real token on every request, and a caller who edits anything in the browser changes the UI and nothing else.

`credentials: "include"` on every auth `fetch` is load-bearing and easy to lose. In the dev loop the API is on its own port, so every auth call is cross-origin, and under the default (`"same-origin"`) the browser **silently drops the `Set-Cookie`**: login returns 200, the identity comes back, and the user stays signed out with nothing in the console to explain it. The server pairs it with `cors_allow_credentials`.

## Why this rather than the browser-side PKCE flow it replaced

Four reasons, each of which was a real limit of the old design:

- **The IdP needs no public origin.** It can sit on a private network, behind a VPN, or bound to loopback. A browser flow requires every user's browser to reach the issuer, which is what forces a self-hosted IdP to be exposed.
- **No tokens in JavaScript.** Access and refresh tokens are created and held server-side. There is nothing in `window` for an XSS to steal.
- **No third-party cookies.** The silent-restore iframe a browser flow depends on is already unreliable and is being switched off by browsers. This design has no equivalent to lose.
- **One origin.** No CORS with the issuer, and no redirect-URI allowlist to keep in step with every deployment.

Staying signed in is likewise a server concern now: the refresh token lives with the broker, so there is no browser-side refresh timer, no single-flight coalescing to get right, and no rotated-token bookkeeping in the bundle.

## Config: the issuer values are SERVER-side now

`oidc_client_id`, `oidc_redirect_uri`, `oidc_scopes` and `jwt_issuer` are read by the **broker**, not by the bundle. `oidc_redirect_uri` is still required even though no browser is redirected — the issuer validates it against the app's registration on the auth request the server makes. Do not add them to the frontend's public env; the browser has no use for them.

The one browser-side config that matters is `API_URL` (empty means same-origin, the common case), read through the generated typed module `src/lib/config_gen.ts`.

**`idp_broker_token` is a real credential and is the reason this file is server-side.** It carries the issuer's authority to create sessions. It must never reach a bundle, a `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`/`VITE_*` name, or a log line.

## The one thing not to change carelessly

The issuer treats "which credentials were checked" as the **caller's** decision. A session created with a user check and NO password check is valid, completes an auth request, and yields real tokens — for someone who proved nothing. Such a token carries no `amr` claim at all, so a downstream validator cannot even detect it.

`devidp.CreateSession` refuses a credential set with no verifying factor before it makes any network call, and the broker builds its request from **typed fields it reads itself**. Do not "simplify" either by forwarding a request body straight through: that single change turns a login form into an impersonation endpoint, and nothing in the response would look wrong.

## React Native is different, and ships a mock

RN has neither half of what makes native sign-in work: no automatic cookie jar on `fetch`, and no same-origin. Shipping the web flow there produces code that **typechecks** (RN's tsconfig includes the DOM lib) and silently never authenticates — every call returns 200 and the next one is anonymous. So `native-login.ts` and `route-guard.tsx` are deliberately not emitted into an RN tree.

What RN gets instead is the credential seam: `AuthProvider` in `src/lib/auth/provider.ts` — `getToken` / `getUser` / `logout` — with `createSessionAuthProvider()` in `src/lib/auth/session-provider.ts` as the scaffolded implementation. It holds no real credential: in mock mode the session is a **fixture** so scaffolded UI has a user to render; against a real backend it is signed out and warns on first use.

To give an RN app real sign-in, implement `AuthProvider` over your IdP's **native SDK** (or a token you obtain and store yourself), use it in `src/lib/auth/context.tsx`, and feed the same object's `getToken` to the transport in `app/_layout.tsx` via `setAuthTokenGetter`. **One credential, one source** — the UI and the requests must read the same object, or they can disagree about who is signed in. The scaffold wires no token bridge by default, on purpose: attaching the fixture token would send an `Authorization` header every real backend rejects, making a 401 look like a server fault rather than an unwired app.

`useAuth()`'s value is identical on every platform, so a component written against it moves between the mobile and browser trees unchanged.

## Using a hosted IdP's own sign-in UI instead

Native sign-in is the scaffolded path, not the only one. If you would rather use a vendor's hosted pages or SDK widget (Clerk, Auth0, Firebase), that flow owns the browser session itself: drop the broker routes and the sign-in screen, mount the vendor's components, and have `context.tsx` read its identity from the vendor's SDK. Swap the backend validator to match (`auth.Clerk(...)` / `auth.Firebase(...)` in `SetupAuth`) and point both halves at the same issuer.

The trade you are making: hosted pages give you MFA, social sign-in and password reset for free, and cost you the branding. Native sign-in keeps the user inside your product and keeps the IdP off the public internet, and you own the screens.

## Rules

- **The browser never contacts the identity provider.** If a frontend file grows an issuer URL, a client id, or a redirect, the flow has been half-reverted — and a tree with two ways to become authenticated only protects the token on one of them.
- **No token in the bundle.** `useAuth()` exposes none, `native-login.ts` stores none, and nothing may put one in `localStorage`, `sessionStorage` or `document.cookie` — anything written there is script-readable, which is the exact exposure the HttpOnly cookie removes.
- **`credentials: "include"`, always**, on every auth fetch. The default silently drops the session cookie cross-origin.
- Identity is for RENDERING. Authorization is the server's, on every request.
- Never put a credential in a bundle's public env (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` / `VITE_*` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_*`) — those are inlined at build time and readable by anyone who loads the page.
- `returnTo` on the sign-in screen is attacker-supplied: accept absolute same-origin paths only. `//evil.com` is protocol-relative, so the second character matters as much as the first.
- The access token your backend validates must be a **JWT**. Some IdPs issue an OPAQUE access token unless the client requests a registered API resource/audience — an opaque string will never validate against a JWKS, however correct the rest of the wiring is.
