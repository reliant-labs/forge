description: Serving your own hostname — the `forge domain` commands for hosted sites and ports, why a hosted domain is a control-plane resource rather than spec, `Port.domains` on a cluster you operate, and reading a bound domain's state.
---

# Custom domains

Every hosted site and exposed hosted port already answers on a hostname the
platform allocates — you never declare that one. To ALSO serve your own, use
the `forge domain` commands. **A hosted domain is NOT spec**: a hosted
frontend or port that carries `domains` is refused at render.

```
forge domain add hounders.club --env prod                # prints the DNS to set
forge domain bind hounders.club --env prod --target web
forge domain bind www.hounders.club --env prod --redirect-to hounders.club
```

`ls`, `show`, `verify` (check DNS now), `unbind` (stop serving, keep the
verification) and `rm` (give the hostname up) complete the group; every read
takes `--json`. `--env` names which control plane to talk to — a domain has
no env, only its binding does.

Why a resource, not a field: bringing a name takes an action at YOUR
registrar, then verification, then a certificate — asynchronous and
human-gated, none of which a deploy converges. It also binds to ONE env,
while an env file renders to many. And the platform may allocate a hostname
itself, which a spec field would then contradict.

If a domain command is rejected for a missing `domain:read`/`domain:write`
scope, the credential lacks it: under Reliant, grant it to your Reliant session
(Settings → Tokens, or `reliant auth login`); standalone, re-run `forge login`.
If a fresh token still lacks it, your role has no grant — an org admin can mint
`forge cloud token create --env <env> --name <n> --scopes domain:read,domain:write`.

## `forge.OnCluster` keeps `Port.domains`

There you own the ingress, forge renders the Gateway and HTTPRoute, and
`forge.WorkloadURL` resolves the exposed port's first domain. At most 8
lowercase DNS names, no wildcards, no duplicates.

```kcl
# OnCluster only — on OnHosted this is a render error.
ports = [fw.Port {name = "http", port = 8080, expose = True, domains = ["api.hounders.club"]}]
```

## Reading a domain's state

`forge env status <env>`, the post-deploy summary and `forge domain show
<hostname>` print each bound domain's state — `pending_dns` | `verifying` |
`issuing` | `live` | `failed` | `conflict` — with the DNS record still to
set and the last error:

```
custom domains (prod):
  web:
    hounders.club: pending_dns
      DNS record to set: A hounders.club → 34.63.203.181
      DNS record to set: TXT _forge-challenge.hounders.club → tok-123
    www.hounders.club: live since 2026-02-01T10:00:00Z
```

A domain that is not live is not a failed deploy: setting the record at your
registrar is your step, which is why forge prints it rather than blocking on
it. `--json` carries the same under each workload's `domains`.
