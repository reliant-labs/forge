# Frontend Development in Forge

## Project Structure

Each frontend lives in `frontends/<name>/` as a Next.js app with App Router. Create one with:

```bash
forge add frontend <name>
```

Key directories inside `frontends/<name>/`:
- `src/app/` — Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `src/components/` — Reusable React components
- `src/hooks/` — Generated and custom hooks
- `src/lib/` — Utilities and Connect RPC client setup

Generated TypeScript clients live in `gen/` at the project root, shared across all frontends.

### Production build shape (`output:`)

`forge add frontend` emits a `next.config.ts` configured for the common forge shape: a Next.js shell that calls a Go backend via Connect RPC. The default is **static export** — production builds emit `out/` (HTML + JS + CSS) that drops straight onto a CDN or object store. No Node runtime in prod → smaller attack surface, free edge caching, no Node image to patch.

The choice is captured in `forge.yaml`:

```yaml
frontends:
  - name: admin
    type: nextjs
    path: frontends/admin
    port: 3000
    output: static       # default — production = static export, dev = next dev
```

Three values are accepted:

| `output:`    | Production shape                            | Use when                                                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `static`     | Static export (`output: "export"`)          | Pure UI shell — all data/auth/logic in a backend (the default for forge projects). |
| `standalone` | Node sidecar (`output: "standalone"`)       | Server components, server actions, request-time `redirect()` / `cookies()`.        |
| `server`     | Full Next.js (no `output:` field)           | Custom server, ISR, managed host (Vercel) where you want `next start` semantics.   |

Opt into a non-default at scaffold time:

```bash
forge add frontend dashboard --output standalone
```

The Dockerfile the scaffold ships is sized for `standalone`. Static deployments can ignore (or delete) it — the production artifact is the contents of `out/`. The `output:` field only takes effect at scaffold time; `next.config.ts` is Tier-2 (yours to edit after scaffold) so changing the YAML later does not retroactively rewrite the file.

If a frontend uses server-runtime APIs (`redirect()` from `next/navigation`, `cookies()`, server actions) it MUST use `output: standalone` or `output: server` — those calls don't work in a static export. The scaffolded `app/page.tsx` (entity tile grid) and `app/layout.tsx` do not use server-only APIs and work under the static default unchanged.

For a root-route redirect (e.g. `/` → `/dashboard`) under static export, do NOT use `redirect()` from `next/navigation` — it requires the Next.js server runtime. Use a client component with `useRouter().replace()`:

```tsx
"use client";

import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

export default function RootPage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  useEffect(() => {
    router.replace("/dashboard");
  }, [router]);
  return null;
}
```

### Serving under a path prefix (`base_path`)

To mount a frontend under a URL prefix (e.g. `/admin` behind a proxy that blends it with another app), declare it in `forge.yaml`:

```yaml
frontends:
  - name: admin
    type: nextjs
    base_path: /admin    # must start with "/", no trailing "/"
```

(or scaffold with `forge add frontend admin --base-path /admin`). What this drives:

- `next.config.ts` sets **both** `basePath` and `assetPrefix` to the same value — `assetPrefix` is required or some RSC chunk URLs skip the prefix and React never hydrates.
- **One env var**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` is the only override forge reads or writes — the same name in `next.config.ts` and in the browser bundle. Never invent a second variant (`ADMIN_WEB_BASE_PATH`, etc.); it will be silently ignored.
- `src/lib/basepath_gen.ts` (Tier-1, regenerated every `forge generate`) exports `BASE_PATH` and `joinBasePath(path)`.
- Static-export builds **fail loudly** if `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` is overridden to empty while `forge.yaml` declares a prefix — a baked root-mounted export 404s behind the proxy.

Rules of thumb:

- Internal navigation: keep using `<Link href="/tasks">` and `router.push("/tasks")` with app-relative paths — Next.js prepends the basePath automatically. Do NOT wrap these in `joinBasePath` (harmless — it's idempotent — but noise).
- Hand-built URLs Next.js can't see — `window.location.origin`-based payment return URLs, OAuth `redirect_uri`, share links, raw `fetch()`/`<a>` paths — go through `joinBasePath`:

```typescript
import { joinBasePath } from "@/lib/basepath_gen";
const successUrl = window.location.origin + joinBasePath("/billing/success");
```

Lint-worthy anti-patterns: bare `"/admin" + path` string literals (break the day the mount point changes), bare `/route` strings in hand-built URLs (bypass the prefix entirely), and reading any env var other than `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`.

For React Native mobile frontends, `forge add frontend <name> --kind mobile` creates an Expo app with the same systems:
- `app/` — Expo Router screens and layouts
- `src/hooks/` — Generated Connect RPC hooks (shared template)
- `src/lib/` — Connect client, event bus, auth provider
- `src/stores/` — Zustand stores (mobile-adapted: drawer, bottom sheet)

## Generated TypeScript Hooks

`forge generate` produces per-service React Query hooks in `src/hooks/`. Read RPCs get `useQuery` hooks, mutating RPCs get `useMutation` hooks. Import from the barrel:

```typescript
import { useGetTask, useCreateTask, useListTasks } from "@/hooks";
```

Do not hand-edit `*-hooks.ts` files — they are overwritten on `forge generate`. For custom hooks, create separate files in `src/hooks/` (e.g., `src/hooks/custom-hooks.ts`).

Base wrappers `useApiQuery` and `useApiMutation` in `src/hooks/` are available for one-off or composite operations that don't map to generated hooks.

## Using the Component Library

Use the `component_library` tool to find production-ready components before building from scratch:

```
component_library(action="search", query="dashboard")
component_library(action="search", tag="chart")
component_library(action="get", name="quadrant_chart")
```

Categories: layouts, charts, diagrams, deck, ui.

### Data viz: use Recharts, not the library

For commodity data viz — bar, line, area, donut, pie, scatter, sparkline — install Recharts:

```bash
npm i recharts
```

Hand-rolling SVG paths for these loses to a real library on every dimension that matters: hover tooltips, click handlers, brush selection, datetime/log axes, locale formatting, dual axes, canvas rendering past ~1k points, accessibility. Don't compete with hundreds of person-years of investment.

The component library only ships **narrative** charts — `quadrant_chart` (competitive matrix), `concentric_circles` (TAM/SAM/SOM), `funnel_chart` (sales conversion) — and the `slide_*` deck charts. These are presentation-grade where heavy customization matters more than interactivity, and where libraries are weakest.

Rule of thumb: if it's going on a dashboard, use Recharts. If it's going on a slide or a marketing page, check the component library first.

### Base UI primitives (always available)

Every forge frontend ships a small set of low-level primitives at scaffold time, under `src/components/ui/`. Pages and frontend packs MUST compose these instead of inlining their own `<button>` / `<input>` / `<table>` markup. The full set:

| Primitive | Import | What it is |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| `button` | `import Button from "@/components/ui/button"` | Generic button — `primary` / `secondary` / `outline` / `ghost` / `danger` variants, sizes, loading state. |
| `input` | `import Input from "@/components/ui/input"` | Generic text input — sizes, invalid state, forwarded ref. Pair with `<Label>`. |
| `label` | `import Label from "@/components/ui/label"` | Form field label with optional required-asterisk. |
| `form` | `import Form, { FormField, FormError, FormActions } from "@/components/ui/form"` | Form structural primitives — root `<form>` plus field/error/actions wrappers. `<FormField>` mints an id and exposes it via `FormFieldContext` so child `<Label>` / `<Input>` / `<Select>` auto-bind without `htmlFor` / `id` boilerplate. |
| `card` | `import Card, { CardHeader, CardBody, CardFooter } from "@/components/ui/card"` | Generic surface primitive. Distinct from `MetricCard`/`StatCards` (domain components). |
| `avatar` | `import Avatar from "@/components/ui/avatar"` | User avatar with image, initials fallback, status indicator. |
| `tabs` | `import Tabs from "@/components/ui/tabs"` | Tab navigation with underline/pills/boxed variants. |
| `table` | `import Table, { TableHeader, TableBody, TableRow, TableHead, TableCell } from "@/components/ui/table"` | Bare structural table — pair with `@tanstack/react-table` for headless sort/filter. |
| `select` | `import Select from "@/components/ui/select"` | Generic select — options array, sizes, invalid state. |
| `chip` | `import Chip from "@/components/ui/chip"` | Removable filter chip / tag. Distinct from `Badge` (status-shaped). |
| `toast_notification` | `import { ToastProvider, useToast } from "@/components/ui/toast_notification"` | Toast/notification system — success/error/warning/info, auto-dismiss. |

Plus the higher-level domain components scaffolded out of the box: `sidebar_layout`, `page_header`, `badge`, `modal`, `skeleton_loader`, `pagination`, `search_input`, `alert_banner`, `key_value_list`, `login_form`.

Two of those higher-level components have well-defined canonical APIs
plus accepted aliases — write new code against the canonical names,
keep the aliases only as a migration-friendly back door:

- **`Badge`** — canonical variants are `error` / `success` / `warning` /
  `info` / `neutral`. Aliases: `danger → error`, `default → neutral`.
  The aliases exist for source-port compatibility (codebases that name
  the destructive badge `danger` and the chrome-less badge `default`
  don't need an adapter table at every call site). New code should use
  the canonical names; reach for an alias only when porting existing
  code and rewriting every call site would be churn.

- **`Modal`** — accepts a footer EITHER as a `footer` slot prop OR
  embedded inside `children`. Canonical is the **`footer` prop** — it
  composes cleanly with `<Modal.Body>`-style headers/bodies, keeps the
  footer styled by the Modal itself (border, padding, button alignment),
  and survives any future Modal API evolution. The
  footer-in-children shape is a source-port shorthand; rewrite to the
  slot prop when you next touch the code.

  ```tsx
  // Canonical: footer slot prop
  <Modal
    open={open}
    onClose={close}
    title="Delete project"
    footer={
      <>
        <Button variant="ghost" onClick={close}>Cancel</Button>
        <Button variant="danger" onClick={confirm}>Delete</Button>
      </>
    }
  >
    Are you sure?
  </Modal>

  // Accepted (source-port shorthand): footer inline in children
  <Modal open={open} onClose={close} title="Delete project">
    <p>Are you sure?</p>
    <div className="mt-4 flex justify-end gap-2">
      <Button variant="ghost" onClick={close}>Cancel</Button>
      <Button variant="danger" onClick={confirm}>Delete</Button>
    </div>
  </Modal>
  ```

These primitives are written as `overwrite: once` from the scaffolder — once installed, they are yours to edit. If you find yourself re-inlining a button or input shape in a page or pack, stop and use the primitive instead.

### Form field auto-binding

`<FormField>` mints a unique id via `React.useId()` and provides it
through `FormFieldContext`. Child `<Label>` reads the context for
`htmlFor`; child `<Input>` / `<Select>` reads the context for `id`.
The page-author writes neither:

```tsx
<Form>
  <FormField>
    <Label required>Email</Label>
    <Input type="email" value={email} onChange={onEmail} />
  </FormField>

  <FormField>
    <Label>Plan</Label>
    <Select
      options={[{ value: "pro", label: "Pro" }, { value: "team", label: "Team" }]}
    />
  </FormField>
</Form>
```

Clicking either label focuses its input. Explicit `htmlFor` on the
Label or `id` on the input still wins, so deterministic ids (for tour
highlights, `aria-describedby` from another node, etc.) remain
straightforward. Custom form controls can opt into the same pattern by
reading `FormFieldContext` themselves — see the doc comment in
`@/components/ui/form`.

### Variant naming conventions

- `Button` ships `primary | secondary | outline | ghost | danger` —
  destructive action is `danger`, not `error`, because Button is
  action-shaped and Badge is status-shaped. (Badge's destructive
  variant has the opposite spelling for the same reason — see
  the Badge entry above for canonical names and accepted aliases.)

## Connect RPC Clients

Import the generated Connect transport from `src/lib/connect.ts` (generated — do not edit):

```typescript
import { useGetTask } from "@/hooks";
// or for direct calls:
import { createClient } from "@connectrpc/connect";
import { MyService } from "@/../../gen/my/service/v1/service_connect";
import { transport } from "@/lib/connect";

export const myServiceClient = createClient(MyService, transport);
```

## Protobuf-ES v2 Patterns

Forge uses protobuf-es v2. Create message instances with `create()`, not constructors:

```typescript
import { create } from "@bufbuild/protobuf";
import { CreateTaskRequestSchema } from "@/../../gen/my/service/v1/service_pb";

// CORRECT — protobuf-es v2
const req = create(CreateTaskRequestSchema, {
  name: "My Task",
  description: "Details here",
});

// WRONG — this is protobuf-es v1 syntax
// const req = new CreateTaskRequest({ name: "My Task" });
```

## Styling with Tailwind CSS v4

This project uses **Tailwind CSS v4**. Key differences from v3:

- **No `tailwind.config.js`** — configuration is done in CSS with `@theme`
- **Import with** `@import "tailwindcss"` in your global CSS (not `@tailwind base/components/utilities`)
- **PostCSS plugin** is `@tailwindcss/postcss` (not `tailwindcss`)
- Use `@theme` blocks in CSS for custom design tokens instead of a config file

```css
/* src/app/globals.css */
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  --color-brand: #3b82f6;
  --font-sans: "Inter", sans-serif;
}
```

Use Tailwind utility classes directly in JSX. Follow responsive-first design (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes).

## CSS Health

Treat CSS as architecture, not a dumping ground. Keep styling predictable and easy to refactor:

- Prefer Tailwind utilities and component variants for layout, spacing, color, and state styling.
- Use CSS variables in `@theme` or scoped CSS for reusable design tokens; do not hard-code one-off colors across components.
- Avoid `!important`. If specificity fights you, simplify selectors, move styles closer to the component boundary, or introduce a variant API.
- Avoid DOM `style={{...}}` props except for truly dynamic runtime values (measured dimensions, CSS custom properties, chart coordinates). Prefer `className` and CSS variables.
- Keep global CSS small: Tailwind import, theme tokens, base element defaults, and app-wide variables only.
- Run `npm run lint:styles` when changing CSS-heavy files; it catches `!important` and invalid Tailwind v4 at-rules.

## Visual Verification

**ALWAYS use BOTH `take_snapshot` AND `take_screenshot` via Chrome DevTools before declaring frontend work complete.**

Snapshots (a11y tree) alone cannot detect CSS/visual issues — layout shifts, misaligned elements, wrong colors, broken responsive layouts, z-index problems, and overflow issues are invisible to snapshots. Screenshots catch what snapshots miss.

```
# After making changes, verify with BOTH:
take_snapshot()         # Check element structure, text content, accessibility
take_screenshot()       # Check visual layout, styling, spacing, colors
```

For responsive testing, resize the page and screenshot at multiple breakpoints.

## Component Patterns

- Use **functional components** with hooks exclusively — no class components.
- Prefer **server components** by default. Add `"use client"` only when you need interactivity, browser APIs, or hooks like `useState`/`useEffect`.
- Keep components small and focused. Extract reusable logic into custom hooks.

## Error Handling

Handle Connect RPC errors by code:

```typescript
import { ConnectError, Code } from "@connectrpc/connect";

try {
  const res = await myServiceClient.createItem({ name: "example" });
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof ConnectError) {
    if (err.code === Code.InvalidArgument) {
      setFieldErrors(err.message);
    } else if (err.code === Code.PermissionDenied) {
      setError("You don't have permission to do this.");
    } else {
      setError("Something went wrong. Please try again.");
    }
  }
}
```

Every data-fetching component must handle three states: **loading**, **success**, and **error**.

## Files NOT to Edit

These files are regenerated by `forge generate` — changes will be overwritten:

- `src/gen/` — Generated TypeScript stubs and clients
- `src/lib/connect.ts` — Connect transport setup
- `src/lib/basepath_gen.ts` — `BASE_PATH` + `joinBasePath()` from `forge.yaml`'s `frontends[].base_path`
- `src/hooks/*-hooks.ts` — Generated React Query hooks

Put custom code in separate files alongside them (e.g., `src/hooks/custom-hooks.ts`, `src/lib/utils.ts`).

## Scaffolded Infrastructure (yours to extend)

These files are created by `forge add frontend` and are yours to modify:

- `src/lib/auth/` — Auth provider interface, stub provider, context. Implement `AuthProvider` to add real auth.
- `src/lib/events.ts` — Typed event bus. Extend the `EventMap` interface to add custom events.
- `src/lib/event-context.tsx` — Event bus React context and hooks.
- `src/stores/ui-store.ts` — Zustand base UI store. Extend or create domain stores in `src/stores/`.
- `src/lib/format-utils.ts` — Shared formatting utilities used by generated pages.
- `src/lib/admin-url.ts` — `adminUrl(path)` + `absoluteAdminUrl(path)` convenience wrappers over the generated `src/lib/basepath_gen.ts` (the single source of truth for the prefix; see "Serving under a path prefix"). Use these (or `joinBasePath` directly) for any string passed to an external system that round-trips back to this frontend (Stripe `success_url`, OAuth `redirect_uri`, share links, magic-link emails) — the basePath leaks through `<Link>` for free but NOT into raw URL strings.

## Dev Workflow

```bash
forge run                # Full stack: infra + Go (hot reload) + Next.js
forge up --env=dev       # Same, but reads deploy/kcl/<env>/ for the host/cluster split
```

Changes to frontend code reflect instantly in the browser. After changing `.proto` files, always regenerate:

```bash
forge generate
```

### How `forge up` runs the frontend

`forge up` dev-serves each declared `forge.Frontend` via `npm run dev`
— it does NOT run `npm run build` in the loop. The prod build is for
`forge build` / `forge deploy`, not the inner-loop. Dev edits hot-reload
without a build step.

The frontend's declared port in KCL (`forge.Frontend.port`) is
**force-injected as the `PORT` env var** into the Next.js child
process. Next.js binds the declared port even if a stale `PORT=...`
bled in from the parent shell — drift between the KCL-declared port,
the generated docker-compose, and the actual dev server is now
structurally impossible.

### Multi-frontend dev URLs (`*.localhost:8080`)

`forge run` spins up a single host-based reverse proxy on
`localhost:8080` that fronts every frontend + HTTP-routed service
under a unified URL pattern:

```
http://admin.localhost:8080   → the admin frontend (KCL port)
http://web.localhost:8080     → the web frontend (KCL port)
http://api.localhost:8080     → the api service (HTTPRoute host match)
```

`*.localhost` resolves to `127.0.0.1` automatically per RFC 6761, so
no `/etc/hosts` edits are needed. The first declared frontend is the
fallback for unmatched hosts (a bare `http://localhost:8080/` works).

**Why host-based, not path-based?** Path prefixes would require
setting `basePath` in `next.config.js` — a file forge does not own,
and a config that affects production routing too. Host-based
dispatch keeps `next.config.js` untouched and gives prod-parity for
free: the same KCL `HTTPRoute.host` values route the same way under
the production Gateway as they do under the dev proxy.

WebSocket upgrades are forwarded with a hijacked TCP splice — this
is what makes Next.js HMR work end-to-end. If HMR breaks, suspect a
backend port that drifted out of the KCL declaration rather than the
proxy itself.

Knobs:
- `forge run --proxy-port 9090` — override the bind port.
- `FORGE_RUN_PROXY_PORT=9090 forge run` — same via env.
- `forge run --no-proxy` — disable the proxy and use the raw per-frontend ports.

Adding service hosts to the dispatch table: declare an HTTPRoute in
your `deploy/kcl/<env>/main.k` with a `host:` value:

```kcl
forge.HTTPRoute {
    name = "api-route"
    service = "api"
    port = 8000
    host = "api.localhost"   # used by `forge run` AND the prod Gateway
}
```

Path-based HTTPRoutes (no `host`, with a `/prefix` match) work in
cluster but are skipped by the dev proxy — the basePath dance is
intentionally avoided in the dev loop.

## Scaffolded Systems

The frontend scaffold includes three extensible systems:

- **Auth provider** (`src/lib/auth/`) — DI'd via `AuthProvider`. Swap in Auth0, Clerk, or custom JWT by implementing the `AuthProvider` interface. `useAuth()` gives you user, token, login, logout.
- **Event bus** (`src/lib/events.ts`) — Typed pub/sub for imperative cross-cutting actions (`toast:show`, `auth:expired`, `navigate`). Extend the event map with your own events. Use `useEvent(name, handler)` in components.
- **UI store** (`src/stores/ui-store.ts`) — Zustand baseline for shared client state (`sidebarCollapsed`, `commandPaletteOpen`). Extend or create domain stores in `src/stores/`.

Mobile (React Native) frontends include the same three systems adapted for mobile:
- **Auth provider** — same `AuthProvider` interface, same `useAuth()` hook
- **Event bus** — same typed pub/sub, plus mobile-specific events (`app:background`, `app:foreground`)
- **UI store** — mobile-adapted: `drawerOpen`, `bottomSheetOpen` instead of `sidebarCollapsed`, `commandPaletteOpen`

## File naming inside `frontends/<name>/src/`

Forge templates follow two TS file-naming conventions, both intentional:

- **Components under `src/components/ui/`** are `snake_case` (`data_table.tsx`, `toast_notification.tsx`, `key_value_list.tsx`). Each file default-exports a single PascalCase component (`Button`, `DataTable`).
- **Hooks, lib utilities, and stores** are `kebab-case` (`use-api-query.ts`, `format-utils.ts`, `ui-store.ts`).

For the full Go / proto / TS / `forge.yaml` casing table, see `architecture` → **Naming conventions**.

## Sub-skills

Load sub-skills for specific frontend topics:

- **state** — State management decision table, state vs events, ownership, async handling
- **patterns** — Component composition, container/presentational, effects discipline, typed boundaries

For frontend testing — what to test, what NOT to test, the `mockTransport()` seam, and recipes per layer — see the top-level `frontend-testing` skill.

## Rules

- Never hand-edit generated files (`*-hooks.ts`, `src/gen/`, `src/lib/connect.ts`).
- Always use `create(Schema, {...})` for protobuf messages, never `new Message()`.
- Run `forge generate` after every `.proto` change.
- Add `"use client"` only when needed — hooks and event handlers require client components.
- Verify frontend work visually with BOTH `take_snapshot` and `take_screenshot`.
- Use the `component_library` tool before building UI components from scratch.
- Use generated React Query hooks for server data — do not copy backend data into Zustand.
- Subscribe to Zustand slices, not the whole store.
- Use the event bus for imperative actions (toasts, navigation commands) — not as a source of truth.
- Keep forms in react-hook-form + Zod — do not hand-roll form state with scattered useState.
