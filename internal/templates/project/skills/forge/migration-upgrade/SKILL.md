# Upgrading a forge project

Use this skill when the forge binary on your PATH is newer than the
`forge_version` recorded in `forge.yaml`, or when `forge generate` warns
about a version mismatch.

## How forge tracks versions

Every `forge.yaml` carries a `forge_version` field set at scaffold time
to the version of `forge project new` that produced the project. The field is
updated only by `forge project upgrade` (never silently by `forge generate`),
so it is a faithful record of the last forge release the project's
generated artifacts were produced against.

Legacy projects that predate the field are treated as `0.0.0`. They
get a one-time nudge from `forge generate` to run `forge project upgrade` so
the baseline can be pinned.

## The supported upgrade window

forge supports upgrading from at most **2 minor releases back** in a
single run (the Istio model). A project further back does a **staged
upgrade**: step to an intermediate release first, then continue.

```
v0.3  v0.4  v0.5  v0.6  v0.7        binary: v0.7
 │                 └──────┴─ project at v0.5: inside the window, one step
 └─ project at v0.3: 4 minors back — stage through v0.5 first
```

Attempting too large a jump is refused with the intermediate version
named:

```text
$ forge project upgrade --to v0.7.0
  v0.3.0 is 4 minor releases behind v0.7.0 — at most 2 minors back
  is supported in one step

  staged upgrade: run 'forge project upgrade --to v0.5' first, then
  re-run the original command
```

Why a window at all: each migration is written against the shapes of the
releases inside it. Migrations compose multiplicatively — N releases back
is N playbooks that must all still apply cleanly, in order, to a tree
none of their authors ever saw. Bounding N is what keeps the registry
small enough that every migration in it is still true.

## How to upgrade

```bash
# Inspect the current pin and the binary version.
grep forge_version forge.yaml
forge version

# See which migrations this project actually needs.
forge project upgrade list

# Preview what the upgrade would change.
forge project upgrade --dry-run        # alias for --check

# Apply.
forge project upgrade                  # bumps to the binary's version
forge project upgrade --to v0.5.0      # bumps to a specific version

# Force-overwrite user-modified frozen files (rare; usually you want
# to inspect the diff first and reconcile manually).
forge project upgrade --force
```

`forge project upgrade` runs in three phases:

1. **Surface applicable migrations.** Every release the project has not
   crossed yet, whose detection script matches the project's current
   shape, printed oldest release first with a `forge skill load <path>`
   command.
2. **Apply template drift.** Frozen Tier-2 files (Taskfile, Dockerfile,
   middleware scaffolds) are diffed against the latest templates; the
   user sees a unified diff for any file they've modified, and unmodified
   files are auto-updated.
3. **Bump `forge_version`** in `forge.yaml` to the target version.

## Reading per-version migration skills

A migration skill at `migrations/<version>` is the playbook for the
breaking changes one RELEASE introduced. Load it by the path
`forge project upgrade list` prints for it.

**Apply them in the order `forge project upgrade list` prints them —
oldest release first.** Each assumes the ones above it have already
landed; running a later release's playbook against a tree still in an
earlier shape is how a staged upgrade corrupts a project.

Every skill follows the same six-section shape:

1. **What changed.** A one-paragraph technical description.
2. **Detection.** How to identify whether your code has the old shape.
3. **Migration (deterministic part).** Commands that `forge project upgrade`
   already runs for you (regen, build).
4. **Migration (manual part).** What user-edited code might need to
   change. This is where the LLM does its real work.
5. **Verification.** `go build && go test && forge lint` plus any
   shape-specific checks.
6. **Rollback.** How to back out if something breaks.

forge intentionally doesn't try to automate the manual steps, because
they touch hand-written code that an LLM is better placed to reason about
than a regex-based rewrite.

Once you've finished a migration's steps:

```bash
forge project upgrade apply <version>   # records it in .forge/migrations.json
```

## Currently shipped migrations

**None.** forge ships no migration skills right now — no release inside
the supported window carries a breaking change that a project can still
be on the wrong side of.

An empty registry is the normal steady state, not a gap. `forge project
upgrade list` says so directly:

```text
No migrations shipped by <this binary> — no release in the supported
upgrade window carries a breaking change.
```

<!-- @forge-only:start -->

## Authoring a migration skill (forge core authors)

Add a migration when a release changes the *shape* of a generated
artifact in a way user code or downstream tooling can observe. A new
annotation, a renamed helper, a changed file layout, a removed config
key — those need one. Pure internal refactors (swapping the regex engine
that parses proto annotations) do not.

### Where it goes and what it's called

One directory per RELEASE, named for that release:

```
internal/templates/project/skills/forge/migrations/v0.5.0/SKILL.md
```

The directory name IS the identifier: it's what `forge project upgrade
list` prints, what `forge project upgrade apply <id>` takes, and what
lands in `.forge/migrations.json`. One skill covers everything that
release broke — do not create a directory per individual change.

### Frontmatter contract

```yaml
---
name: v0.5.0
description: the deploy target moved from forge.yaml into KCL
relevance: migration
version: v0.5.0
detection: grep -q '^dev_target:' forge.yaml
---
```

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | yes | Human-readable title. |
| `description` | yes | One line; this is what the worklist prints. |
| `relevance` | no | `migration` — defaulted from the directory, declare it anyway. |
| `version` | yes | The release that introduced the break. **Must equal the directory name** (a test pins this). |
| `detection` | yes | Shell snippet, run in the project root. Exit 0 means the project still has the old shape. |

A migration applies when **both** hold: the project's pinned
`forge_version` is BELOW `version`, and `detection` exits 0.

### Writing detection: state, never version

Detection must test what the tree CONTAINS, never what version it claims
to be. The version half of the decision is already made by the `version`
field, and duplicating it there breaks the two cases that matter most:

- **Unpinned or dev-built projects.** A project bridged to a local forge
  checkout pins a pseudo-version; one predating `forge_version` has no
  pin at all. Neither has a usable position on the timeline, so forge
  falls back to detection ALONE. A version-based detection returns
  nothing useful here.
- **Multi-release jumps.** A project crossing four releases at once gets
  all four migrations. Each one must independently answer "does this tree
  still have my old shape?" — including after the previous three have
  already rewritten parts of it.

Good detection is a grep or a file test — three examples of the
`detection:` frontmatter value:

```text
test -f pkg/app/wire_gen.go
rg -q 'forge:server-set' internal/
grep -q '^dev_target:' forge.yaml
```

A migration with no detection applies to NOTHING — it cannot demonstrate
any project needs it, so it stays out of every worklist rather than
landing in all of them.

### The pruning rule

**When a release ages out of the supported window, DELETE its skill.**
Not archive, not mark retired — delete.

The window is `supportedUpgradeWindowMinors` in
`internal/cli/upgrade_migrations.go` (currently 2). A project older than
that cannot reach the migration anyway: it gets the staged-upgrade
refusal instead, which routes it through an intermediate release where
the migration was still in the window.

A skill nothing can reach is a skill nothing tests. Keeping it around
grows the registry without bound and leaves playbooks that quietly stop
being true. Deleting it is what makes the honest answer — "stage through
vX first" — the only answer that path can give.

## Deprecation cycle policy

When forge changes the shape of a generated artifact:

- **Old shape works for N versions with warnings.** N is at least 2
  minor versions (e.g. an old shape introduced before 1.4 stays
  buildable, with deprecation warnings, through 1.5 and 1.6). This is the
  same 2 the upgrade window uses, and not a coincidence: a project inside
  the window is a project whose shapes forge still supports.
- **Old shape removed in next major.** A 2.0 release is allowed to
  delete the old shape entirely.
- **Behavioural fingerprints preserved across the cycle.** Mock
  not-set error strings, slog attribute keys, span names, and metric
  names are locked by fingerprint tests. A migration that breaks one
  of those gets called out explicitly in the skill's "What changed"
  section.

  already-forge project.

## Post-merge gotchas

Two things to know when `forge project upgrade` interacts with branches:

- **Recommended branch order: upgrade on `main` first, then merge into
  work branches.** The reverse (running `forge project upgrade` on a work
  branch and then merging `main` back in) produces ApplyDeps codemod
  conflicts that are painful to reconcile — the bootstrap/wire layer
  gets rewritten twice from different baselines, and the textual merge
  cannot tell which side owns which call. Treat `forge project upgrade` like a
  global codemod: land it on `main`, then rebase every open branch.
- **Generated-file merge conflicts: regenerate, don't hand-merge.**
  There is no global checksums manifest to reconcile anymore — each
  generated file carries its own `forge:hash` marker, so a textual
  merge of two pristine renders produces a file whose marker no longer
  verifies. Resolve by accepting either side and running
  `forge generate` (the writer heals pristine-but-stale vintages
  loudly); only a file BOTH branches hand-edited needs real conflict
  resolution, and the drift guard will name it.
