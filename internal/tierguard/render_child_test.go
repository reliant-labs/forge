// Rendering a fixture costs ~30s of real codegen (project new, scaffold,
// buf, sqlc, go mod tidy) and the guard needs four of them. Run serially
// that is the single slowest package in the repo; run concurrently it is
// roughly the cost of the slowest fixture.
//
// They cannot be made concurrent in-process. render() drives forge
// through forgeIn, which sets the working directory with os.Chdir and
// the command line with os.Args, and it reads the Tier-1 inventory from
// checksums.Tier1TargetSet. All three are process-global: two renders
// sharing them would chdir out from under each other and cross-attribute
// targeted files. That is not a lock we can take — the globals are the
// pipeline's own interface, and serializing on them just restores the
// original runtime.
//
// So each render gets its own PROCESS, where the globals are private
// again. The child is this same test binary re-executed with a marker
// argv, which is the mechanism the protoc-gen-forge dispatch in TestMain
// already established; the child renders exactly one fixture and writes
// the result back as JSON on stdout.

// renderChildArgv is the marker argv that turns this test binary into a
// single-fixture renderer. It is not a flag: TestMain inspects os.Args[1]
// before the testing package parses anything, exactly as the
// protoc-gen-forge dispatch does.

// renderChildResult is the wire form of a renderResult.
//
// renderResult carries map[string][]byte for the file bodies, which
// encoding/json renders as base64 strings and decodes back to bytes
// without loss, so the struct crosses the process boundary as-is. The
// bodies are the whole point of the guard, so they travel with it rather
// than being re-read by the parent — the parent would then be reading a
// tree the child had already post-processed (marker-stripped), which is
// the kind of skew that makes a guard quietly compare the wrong bytes.

	// TestTier1InventoryIsProducerDerived's "the set was populated
	// through the checksums chokepoint" — is a statement about the
	// rendering process's memory, and the parent no longer renders. The
	// observation therefore has to travel with the result rather than
