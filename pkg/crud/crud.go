// Reason codes: the machine-readable half of every error this package
// puts on the wire.
//
// # Why they exist
//
// A Connect code and a human message are not enough to route a UI. The
// code is too coarse (three different CRUD failures all arrive as
// InvalidArgument) and the message is not a contract at all — it is
// display copy, and forge reserves the right to reword it. Left with
// only those two, callers reach for the one discriminator that appears
// to work: matching the prose. A real dogfood run produced exactly that,
// `text.includes("already exists")`, on a duplicate-email conflict, which
// is the failure mode forge's own frontend runtime documentation forbids
// (web-runtime/src/errors.ts: key off `error.reason`, never the message).
// The instruction was right and the header did not exist.
//
// Every error returned by this package now carries one of the codes
// below as svcerr.ReasonHeader ("x-forge-error-reason") metadata, which
// connect-go merges into the HTTP response headers for unary calls and
// into the end-stream trailer for streaming ones. The frontend reads it
// as ConnectClientError.reason.
//
// # Design rules these names follow
//
//  1. A reason names the CAUSE, not the Connect code. A reason that
//     merely echoes the code ("already_exists" for CodeAlreadyExists)
//     carries no information the client did not already have, and it is
//     the name that must be SPLIT later when a second cause maps to the
//     same code — breaking every caller keyed on it. Cause names never
//     need splitting; new causes get new names.
//  2. The vocabulary is TOTAL. Every error path here sets a reason,
//     including the unclassified one (ReasonInternal). A frontend that
//     switches on `error.reason` must never fall through to null, or it
//     is back to sniffing prose for whatever the switch missed. This is
//     the property the wire tests assert.
//  3. Reasons are engine-neutral. They describe what the CALLER did
//     wrong (or what the server could not do), not which SQLSTATE
//     postgres returned. "duplicate" outlives a migration to a different
//     database; "unique_violation" is postgres vocabulary leaking into a
//     public contract. The violated constraint's NAME belongs in the
//     MESSAGE, never in the reason: a reason is the stable thing a switch
//     is written against, and constraint names move with migrations.
//  4. Reasons distinguish only what a client can ACT on differently.
//     Where the client's only move is "report it and retry", the reason
//     is ReasonInternal, however the failure arose.
//
// These are a public wire contract. Adding a code is cheap; changing the
// meaning of one is not.
