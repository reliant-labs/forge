// Package deploy is forge's deploy-tier library: the pure functions that
// operate on the tier specs in pkg/deploy/v1alpha1.
//
//   - Render (render.go) turns a spec into the Kubernetes objects that run
//     it. It is PURE and DETERMINISTIC: same input, byte-identical output,
//     nothing derived from the time, the environment or a cluster read. Two
//     executors call it — `forge env deploy` when self-hosted and the
//     control plane's operators when hosted — and if the function could
//     disagree with itself, those executors would fight over the same
//     objects forever.
//   - CheckShapeBand / RatioFloor (shape.go) are the hosted billing rule, in
//     one place.
//   - ObservedStateOf / Converged (observed.go) map observed status onto the
//     deploy ledger's vocabulary.
//
// Nothing here talks to a cluster, a registry, a bucket or the control plane.
// Hosted concerns — per-customer namespaces, hostname allocation, registry
// allowlists, quota, secret materialization — are composed AROUND Render's
// output by the control plane. They never enter this package.
