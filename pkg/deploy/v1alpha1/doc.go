// Package v1alpha1 is the ONE declaration of forge's deploy kinds —
// Workload, StaticSite and ManagedDatabase — in API group forge.dev.
//
// # ONE DECLARATION, TWO DESTINATIONS
//
// These types are the single source of truth for what an app author can say
// about a tier. forge's KCL schemas for the tiers are GENERATED from them
// (kcl/tiers/tiers_gen.k), and the control plane's CRDs are these types
// verbatim. That is the whole point of this package: the same declaration
// deploys self-hosted (forge renders it with deploy.Render and applies it) and
// hosted (the control plane receives it as a CR, calls the same Render, and
// composes its hosted concerns around the result). Before this package there
// were four definitions of a hosted backend — forge's KCL schema,
// control-plane's CRD, control-plane's deployrender config and a JSONB row
// struct — using three unit systems and three different sets of env
// channels. ADR 0002 (docs/adr/0002-one-workload-model.md) then folded every
// other way to declare a runnable thing into the one Workload kind.
//
// # WHAT IS SPEC, WHAT IS NOT
//
// A spec holds ONLY what the app author declares. Two categories of
// information that the previous definitions put on the spec are absent from it,
// on purpose:
//
//   - HOSTED IDENTITY (org, customer, environment id, deployment id, and the
//     namespace the platform assigns). A spec field is something an author can
//     WRITE, and ownership must never be author-writable. The control plane
//     stamps identity as labels (see the Label* constants) on the CR it
//     publishes. It also makes "same declaration, two destinations" literally
//     true: a spec carrying an org id cannot be deployed to a cluster that has
//     no org.
//   - OBSERVED FACTS (allocated hostname, URL, phase, the digest actually
//     live). Those are status, written by whoever observed them — the
//     operator on hosted, `forge env status` computing it on read when
//     self-hosted.
//
// Cluster and namespace are also absent. Both describe the TARGET, not the
// app, and the target is the environment's deploy block. forge's own KCL
// doc admitted this ("the platform fills these in; they are not an app-facing
// knob"). The renderer takes the namespace as a RenderContext argument.
//
// # THE SCHEMA IS CLOSED, AND RESTRICTION IS A PROFILE
//
// The schema is closed. A field that is not declared cannot be expressed:
// KCL refuses it at author time and the API server's structural schema
// prunes it at apply time. So the Kubernetes surface a Workload can reach
// is an ALLOWLIST by construction. There is no securityContext, no node
// placement, no volumes and no raw-manifest passthrough, and a new PodSpec
// field is unreachable until someone adds it here on purpose.
//
// Inside that closed set, what a DESTINATION accepts is a Profile (see
// profile.go). ProfileFull is a cluster the author operates.
// ProfileRestricted is the hosted runtime on shared nodes, and it refuses
// RBAC, CRDs, raw Secret and ConfigMap reads and the other fields that
// reach past the tenant's own pod. Every spec field is classified in one
// table, FieldProfiles, and a reflection test fails the build when a field
// is added without a classification. That keeps the profile default-deny.
//
// # INVARIANTS LIVE IN GO
//
// Every rule a tier enforces lives in Validate() here, and forge's KCL
// schema carries a generated copy. The previous design kept the rules
// (the resource ratio band, image pinning) only as KCL checks, and the
// hosted path — which never ran forge's KCL — bypassed them. The live dev
// cluster ran a hosted backend at 100m/128Mi, off the band the KCL check
// claimed to guarantee. The KCL copy is still useful, because it fails at
// author time with a message naming the field. But it is a convenience, and
// Validate() is the check.
