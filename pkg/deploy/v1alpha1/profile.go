// Profile is what a DESTINATION allows a Workload to say (ADR 0002 §3).
//
// It is a property of where the workload runs, never of the workload. The
// hosted control plane picks it server-side from the destination's
// isolation. The CLI runs the same check at render time only so the author
// sees the error before publishing. A client-chosen profile would be a
// hosted user choosing their own sandbox.
//
// Profiles are ORDERED from most to least permissive. A field classified
// at profile X is allowed under X and every more permissive profile, which
// is what Permits encodes.

// THE TABLE IS DEFAULT-DENY. Validate walks a spec by reflection and
// refuses, under EVERY profile, any set field whose path is missing from
// this table, and TestFieldProfilesClassifyEverySpecField fails the build when a
// field is added to the spec without an entry. So a new field can never
// silently become writable by a hosted user: someone has to write down which profile
// allows it.
//
// Paths are JSON names joined with '.', and list elements share their list's
// path ("env.value", "ports.expose"). A field classified ProfileFull is
// refused whole under ProfileRestricted, so its children need no entry.
// Every child of a Restricted-allowed struct needs one.
