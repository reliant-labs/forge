// every consumer then re-derives the distinction from fields the boolean
// was supposed to save it from reading.

// [StateUnknown] is the ZERO VALUE, and that is load-bearing. An opaque
// `External` target runs a command forge cannot read back; there is
// genuinely nothing to observe, and the honest answer is "I do not
// know". Making it the zero value means a Record built by any path —
// a backend that failed halfway, a test literal, a file written by an
// older forge — reads as unknown rather than as green. A dashboard that
// shows green for something nobody measured is worse than one that shows
// nothing, because it is confidently wrong and people stop reading it.

//     match onto a crash-looping workload is degraded. This is the check
//     that stops "the apply succeeded" from being reported as success.
//  3. DRIFT IS COMPUTED OVER OWNED FIELDS ONLY. A replica count that

//     reported.
