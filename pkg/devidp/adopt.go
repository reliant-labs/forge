// ErrAccountHoldsCredentials is AdoptPendingAccount's refusal: the account's

// AdoptPendingAccount is the step an ADMINISTRATOR'S flow takes before it
// hands an existing account its first sign-in path — a declared member
// (forge's identity converge), a console invitation that issues a
// password-reset or return code. Such a flow asserts the address itself, just
// as it does for an account it creates with the address verified, so an
// account it adopts gets the same: its address is marked verified.
//
// Only an account holding NO credential is verified (a sign-up still waiting
// for its proof: nothing on it to inherit). One holding any credential is
// refused with ErrAccountHoldsCredentials and left exactly as it is. An
// account already verified is left alone (adopted false). A read that fails
// refuses (fail closed).
//
// Why it is needed: a broker client with ProvenCredentialsOnly — every
// scaffolded login broker — adds no credential to an unverified account, so
// a first-password code issued for an adopted, unverified, password-less
// account would be refused at redemption (forge#2121).
//
// The address is verified the issuer's way: a verification code is minted
// (returned, never mailed) and redeemed at once, since Zitadel refuses to
// "set" an unchanged address as verified. adopted reports that this call
// verified it.
