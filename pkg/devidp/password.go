// Password reset for the API-only sign-in flow: redeeming a one-time code
// for a new password, with the browser still never contacting the issuer.
//
// ── Where the code comes from is NOT this file's business ────────────────
//
// Zitadel issues a password-reset code either by mailing it (its default,
// which needs SMTP) or, with `returnCode`, by handing it back to whoever
// asked. Who may ask is a deployment decision — a privileged operator
// command, a mail sender, a support tool — so this file only REDEEMS codes.
// Minting one belongs to whatever holds the management credential, never to
// a request path.
//
// ── THE HAZARD THIS FILE EXISTS TO CONTAIN ──────────────────────────────
//
// The login broker's credential (IAM_LOGIN_CLIENT — see EnsureLoginBroker)
// is allowed to call SetPassword WITHOUT a verification code, and Zitadel
// then simply overwrites the password. Verified against v4.16.2: the broker
// token set a new password on another user with no code in the body, HTTP
// 200. The same token can also mint a reset code with `returnCode`.
//
// So the broker credential can already take over any account, and a reset
// handler's safety rests ENTIRELY on the code it forwards being one the
// PERSON supplied. ResetPassword therefore refuses an empty code before any
// network call, exactly as buildChecks refuses a passwordless session: a
// handler that forwarded a blank field would otherwise turn a reset form
// into "set anyone's password", and the response would look like success.
//
// It also matters what Zitadel does NOT do: it does not burn a code after
// failed attempts (verified: eight wrong codes, then the right one still
// worked). A six-character code with unlimited guesses is a brute-force
// target, so an attempt cap is the CALLER's job.

// ErrUserNotFound is returned by FindUserByEmail when no human user has that
// address — or when more than one does, which is treated the same way: a
// reset keyed by an ambiguous email cannot know whose password it is
// changing.
var ErrUserNotFound = errors.New("no single user has that email address")

// ErrInvalidResetCode means the issuer rejected the reset code: wrong,
// expired, or already used. Deliberately one error for all three — a form
// that tells "expired" from "wrong" teaches a guesser when to stop.
var ErrInvalidResetCode = errors.New("the reset code is not valid for this user")

// PasswordPolicyError means the code was ACCEPTED but the new password
// failed the issuer's password policy. The code is still valid afterwards
// (verified), so the person should pick a different password, not ask for a
// new code — which is why a caller must be able to tell this apart from
// ErrInvalidResetCode.
