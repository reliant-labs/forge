// ── Pre-registration takeover, ruled out by construction ────────────────
//
// THE ATTACK: someone registers victim@example.com with a password of their
// own, or links their own social account to it. The account is unverified.
// When the owner of the inbox later proves the address, the proof must not
// hand them — or leave the squatter — an account the squatter set up.
//
// The broker used to answer that by EVICTING: every proof took the account's
// credentials back, before the proof as well as after it, under a lock, a
// time fence and finally a cross-replica lock (forge#1821, #2098, #2166). A
// proof that FAILED still evicted, and a stale eviction could land on a
// credential the owner had just set (forge#2121). The class of bug existed
// because the state existed. Now it cannot:
//
//  1. NO CREDENTIAL IS EVER PUT ON AN UNVERIFIED ACCOUNT. An account may
//     exist before its address is proven — that is how the issuer mails the
//     code — but it holds nothing: a sign-up's password and an unverified
//     provider's link wait, sealed in the browser that chose them, until that
//     browser proves the address. The Client calls that add a credential
//     refuse an unverified account (ErrUnverifiedAccount), so no path can
//     slip one in.
//  2. A PROOF NEVER VERIFIES AN ACCOUNT THAT HOLDS A CREDENTIAL. Such an
//     account predates this rule, or is a contact-only account (a sign-up
//     where no mail could prove the address, MetaContactOnly). Its
//     credentials prove nothing, and taking them away needs calls the issuer
//     cannot aim (its TOTP removal names no factor). So it is left exactly as
//     it is, and refused at the proof (errHoldsCredentials). The owner
//     proves into a FRESH, credential-less account instead, which takes the
//     address over once proven (fresh_account.go). Nothing is deleted.
//
// So a proof's only write is the issuer's own verification of a
// credential-less account. A failed or abandoned proof changes nothing, and
// there is nothing to evict, lock, fence or serialise.

// maxPasswordBytes bounds a password the sign-up routes accept, so a sealed
// binding that carries one keeps its fixed size.
const maxPasswordBytes = 256

// errHoldsCredentials refuses a proof of an unverified account that holds a
// credential: nothing proves who set it, so the address is proven into a
// fresh account instead (or, for an invitation, by an administrator).

// ErrUnverifiedAccount is returned by every Client call that would add a

// proveAddress runs proof — the issuer's check of an emailed code, which also

// nothing of its own. A proof of an unverified account that holds any
// credential is refused with errHoldsCredentials before the issuer is asked:
// verifying it would make whatever was set on it before the proof usable.
//
// Nothing can add a credential between that read and the proof: every call
// that adds one refuses an unverified account.
