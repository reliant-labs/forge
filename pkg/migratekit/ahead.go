// SCHEMA AHEAD OF THE BINARY — the rollback case.
//
// A rollback deploys an OLDER release against a database the newer release
// already migrated. Its migrator meets a recorded version it does not embed,
// and golang-migrate reports that as
//
//	no migration found for version 92: read down for version 92 ...: file does not exist
//
// — a hard error, so the migrate step fails and with it the rollback, at the
// moment a rollback is needed. control-plane's v1.7.0 release (migrations 91
// and 92 on top of v1.6.0's 90) is the case that surfaced it.
//
// Neither obvious answer is right. Failing always makes rollback impossible;
// tolerating always runs old code on a schema nobody checked it against, which
// is how a rollback turns an incident into data loss. The answer is a FACT the
// older binary can check: whether every version it does not know was declared
// backward-compatible by its author (see package compat). The older binary
// has never seen those files, so it cannot read the declaration itself — the
// NEWER migrator records it in the database as it applies them, in
// compatTable, and the older one reads it back.
//
// Versions a compat-unaware migrator applied have no row, and are treated as
// NOT compatible: an unproven claim is refused, never assumed.

// compatTable is the bookkeeping table the migrator keeps beside golang-
// migrate's schema_migrations: one row per migration version a compat-aware
// binary embedded, with what that migration declared. Unqualified, so it
// lands in the same schema (the search_path's first) schema_migrations does.
const compatTable = "schema_migrations_compat"

// compatLockKey serializes the table's create-and-upsert across replicas
// racing the same release. CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS is not race-free in
// postgres (two creators can collide on the catalog's unique index), and
// golang-migrate's own advisory lock is only held inside its Up call.
