// A VERSION NUMBER IS NOT A MIGRATION'S IDENTITY.
//
// golang-migrate records one integer: the schema is "at 93". It cannot say
// WHICH 93. Two branches that each add a migration numbered 93 both apply
// cleanly to a shared database, and when one of them is renumbered before it
// merges, the database stays stamped with the branch's 91..93 while main's
// 91..93 — different files — never run. Every later `up` agrees the schema is
// current, and the first symptom is a query for a column that does not exist,
// usually in a crash-looping pod far from the migration that owns it.
//
// So the migrator keeps a second fact beside the version: for each version it
// applied, the descriptor of the file it ran (appliedTable). Before applying
// anything, it checks every recorded version this binary also embeds against
// the file the binary has under that number, and refuses on a mismatch.
//
// Only the DESCRIPTOR is compared, never a content hash. A hash would turn
// every comment fix or whitespace strip in an old migration into a refusal to
// boot, while the failure this exists for — a different migration under the
// same number — always changes the name.
//
// Versions applied before this record existed have no row and are not
// checked. They are deliberately NOT backfilled from the binary's own
// filenames: that would certify whatever the database already holds, which is
// exactly the state this check cannot vouch for.

// appliedTable is the per-version record of which file was applied.
// Unqualified, like schema_migrations and compatTable, so it lands in the
// search_path's first schema.
