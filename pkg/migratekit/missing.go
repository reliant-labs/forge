// A MIGRATION THAT ARRIVES AFTER THE SCHEMA PASSED IT.
//
// golang-migrate tracks ONE number: the schema is "at 93". Its readUp reads
// that number and applies only migrations ABOVE it. So a migration numbered
// BELOW the current version can never run — golang-migrate does not look
// there, and reports nothing missing. It has no allow-missing option.
//
// With timestamp versions this happens exactly one way: two branches are cut,
// A allocates an earlier timestamp than B, and B merges and DEPLOYS first.
// Main now holds A's migration at a version the database has already passed.
// Every later `up` agrees the schema is current, and A's SQL never runs. The
// first symptom is a query for a column that does not exist, usually in a
// crash-looping pod far from the migration that owns it.
//
// So the migrator checks, before applying anything: every version this binary
// embeds at or below the schema's current version must have a row in
// appliedTable. One that does not was never applied and never will be. That
// is a MissingMigrationError, and nothing runs.
//
// WHY REFUSE RATHER THAN APPLY IT. Applying a late migration out of order is
// expressible (goose's WithAllowMissing does it) and it silently makes the
// schema depend on merge ORDER: A-then-B and B-then-A produce different
// databases from the same commit, and nothing reports which one you got. A
// DROP COLUMN landing after the migration that reads the column is a
// different schema from the reverse. For the least reversible thing that
// ships, the loud refusal beats the quiet guess — a human re-versions the
// file, which is a rename, because the branch has not deployed yet.
//
// The measurement behind that choice: across 108 migrations of control-plane
// history there were ten same-version collisions (which timestamps remove
// outright) and ZERO out-of-order arrivals. This check guards a case that is
// rare by construction, so refusing costs almost nothing and assuming costs
// a schema nobody reviewed.

// RebaseCommand is the forge command that re-versions a migration, named by
// this package's refusal message.
//
// It is spelled out here rather than imported because pkg/ may not depend on
// forge's internal packages — this error travels into user projects, which
// link only pkg. The internal copy lives in
// internal/linter/migrationlint.RebaseCommand, and a test in internal/cli
// asserts that both spellings resolve to a real CLI command. That test is the
// reason for this comment: this string was advice for a subcommand that did
// not exist, and a user following it hit "unknown command".

// mark is precisely the claim that those ran. The descriptor is left EMPTY,
// never backfilled from this binary's filenames: a descriptor states which
// FILE was applied, and the one fact an old database cannot vouch for is
// which file it ran under a given number. Writing this binary's names there
// would certify exactly the state the mismatch check exists to catch.
//
// WHY AT CREATION AND NOWHERE ELSE. The bootstrap and a genuinely missing
// migration look identical from a single row's absence — both are "no row at
// a version the schema has passed". They are told apart by WHEN: before the
// table exists, an absent row means nobody was recording; after, it means the
// version never ran. Creating the table and backfilling it in ONE transaction
// makes that boundary a fact in the database rather than a heuristic. A
// backfill that ran on every startup would re-absolve every missing migration
// forever and silently disable the check.
