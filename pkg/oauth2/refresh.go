// RefreshRequest describes a refresh-token redemption (RFC 6749 §6).

// There is no Verifier field. PKCE binds the AUTHORIZATION CODE to the client
// instance that started the flow (RFC 7636 §4.5); the refresh grant presents no
// code, so there is no challenge to satisfy. The refresh token is itself the
// credential, which is why [RefreshRequest.RefreshToken] is a [RefreshToken]
// rather than a bare string — see that type for what it refuses to disclose.

	Endpoint string

	// ClientID must be the client the refresh token was issued to.
	// Required: RFC 6749 §6 requires it for a public client, and a
	// provider that cannot identify the client cannot check the binding.
	ClientID string

	// ClientSecret authenticates a confidential client. Leave it empty for
	// a public client (browser SPA, native app, CLI). When set it is sent
	// in the request body as client_secret.

	// scope no broader than the original grant, and providers reject a
	// widening. Leave it nil to keep the original scope, which is what

	// as sending an empty one, and this package omits it when nil.

// RefreshToken is a refresh token: a long-lived credential that mints access

//
// It is a distinct type from a plain string, and holds its value in an

// dangerous than the access token it produces, because it outlives every token
// it mints. It redacts itself under fmt and log/slog.
//
// Unlike Verifier, it does NOT fail to marshal: a caller legitimately needs to
// carry a refresh token in a session so that a refresh can happen later, and
// Verifier's "fail rather than emit a placeholder" rule exists precisely
// because a verifier is single-use within one login. See [RefreshToken.Secret]
// for taking the value out deliberately.

// Refresh redeems req.RefreshToken for a new access token (RFC 6749 §6).
//
// # Rotation
//
// A provider MAY return a new refresh token, and RFC 6749 §6 says the client
// MUST then discard the old one. Many providers rotate on EVERY refresh and
// treat a re-presented old token as theft: they revoke the entire grant, which
// signs the user out completely rather than merely failing one call. Verified
// against Logto 1.41.0, which rotates every time and, outside a three-second
// grace window, answers a replayed token with invalid_grant AND kills the
// grant — so the newest token dies too.
//
// This function therefore reports what to present NEXT rather than leaving the
// caller to infer it. [Refreshed.RefreshToken] is ALWAYS the token to use for
// the following refresh: the rotated one when the provider sent one, otherwise
// the one just presented. A caller that stores it unconditionally is correct
// under both provider behaviours, and there is no branch to get wrong.
//
// A provider error response becomes an [*Error] (use [errors.As]); a 200 with
// no access token becomes [ErrNoAccessToken]. Neither is reported as success.
