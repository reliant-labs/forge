// File: log_policy.go — which SUCCESSFUL calls get a log record.
//
// By default, every one. The logging layers — LoggingInterceptor at the RPC
// edge, LogMiddleware at the in-process component boundary — write a record
// for every failure AND every success, so an app that configures nothing
// sees each call it served. That is what a developer reading a dev stack
// expects, and what makes "is this process doing its job?" answerable from
// a production log.
//
// SAMPLING IS OPT-IN, for the deployment where an access log's volume — the
// traffic's volume — outgrows its value: a frontend polling three RPCs every
// couple of seconds produced 47k "rpc completed" lines in twelve hours of one
// dev stack, 92% of the API server's INFO output. Turned on, successes are
// SAMPLED IN TIME, per call name: the first success of a name is written,
// then at most one per window, and each sampled record carries `suppressed`
// — how many successes of that name since the previous record were not
// written. Volume is then bounded by the number of distinct names rather
// than by traffic, every active name keeps a heartbeat, and the count keeps
// the rate recoverable from the log alone. A sampling RATE (log 1 in N) was
// the alternative and is the weaker knob: its volume still grows with
// traffic, so the setting that tamed a poll today floods again at ten times
// the users, and a probabilistic rate can hide a rarely-called name
// entirely.
//
// # Where the window comes from
//
// Only from the caller: WithSuccessSampling(window), passed to
// LoggingInterceptor / LogMiddleware directly or through Deps.LogOptions /
// DefaultMiddlewareDeps.LogOptions. Nothing set means no sampling — every
// success is written. A window of zero or less means the same.
//
// The library never consults the process environment for it. A value read
// from the ambient environment appears in no config proto, no KCL env block
// and no typed config object, so nothing the app can read explains why the
// same binary logs differently on two machines (pkg/.golangci.yml forbids
// it). A forge app declares log_success_sample_window in proto/config, sets
// it per environment in deploy/kcl/<env>/config.k, and its scaffolded
// serve.go passes the loaded value to Chain as LogOptions — so the value the
// config loader validated is the value in effect. A package's
// observe_chain.go seam opts its component layer in the same way, with a
// trailing WithSuccessSampling on LogMiddleware.
//
// # Never sampled
//
//   - failures — every one is written with full fields (the policy is not
//     consulted for them at all);
//   - slow successes — at or above the slow threshold, written with
//     slow=true at the default success level, or at the name's own level
//     when that is higher (so turning a poll down to DEBUG never hides the
//     call that hung).
//
// # Expected errors are outcomes, not failures
//
// Some errors are answers: a storage lookup that found no object, a
// registry that holds no such repository. The component returning one did
// its job, and its caller turns the answer into a 404 or an empty list. A
// layer told so by WithExpectedErrors / WithExpectedErrorFunc logs such an
// error through this policy — the success path, with the error and
// expected=true attached — instead of as a failure. Only the component knows
// which of its errors are answers, so nothing is expected by default.
