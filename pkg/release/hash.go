// The hashes a render is identified by. Two, at two scales.
//
// PER OBJECT, [ObjectHashes] gives Hash and ConfigHash, which a [ShapeObject]
// carries and drift detection compares a live object against.
//
// PER RENDER, [ConfigDigest] gives the whole env's config digest — doc §2.1's
// second digest, and the one the names make confusing, so: a bundle has
//
//   - `digest`, the OCI manifest digest of the whole artifact, pins included.
//     It is the bundle's identity and it changes on every release. The
//     transport computes it; nothing here does.
//   - `config_digest`, from this file: the render with every release-bound
//     image reference normalized to its artifact key. It is the SHAPE of the
//     deploy independent of which release it pins.
//
// That split is what makes "same config, new images" (a promotion) and "same
// images, new config" (a spec-change deploy) both one comparison rather than
// a 2 MB YAML diff.

// "this object" and not "these bytes". encoding/json sorts an object's keys,
// so a renderer that reorders a map, reflows a list or changes its
// indentation produces the same hash — while any change to a VALUE changes
// it. Comparing YAML text would make every cosmetic render change look like
// drift, which is the signal this hash exists to carry.
//

// this is exported for the one case that has already redacted and needs the

// config digest. A digest over the packed layer would move on both, and would
// therefore report a cosmetic render change as a config change on every
// deploy.
