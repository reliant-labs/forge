// The deploy PLAN (owner decision O-13).
//
// With a promotion converger on, writing a promotion IS the deploy: nothing
// stands between the write and the rollout. So the review has to happen
// BEFORE the record, and the approval has to be bound to exactly what was
// reviewed. A Plan is that review: the bundle about to be deployed, compared
// against what is live, classified so the dangerous changes cannot hide among
// the ordinary ones, and digested so an approval names one plan and no other.
//
// # One function, both sides
//
// [BuildPlan] is the ONLY place a plan is computed. A hosted backend
// recomputes it under the environment's row lock when the approval arrives
// and refuses unless the digests match; a file ledger does the same under its
// lock. Because both call this function, a digest mismatch means the world
// moved between plan and approve — never that two implementations disagreed
// about the rules. The table tests over the stop-class rules are therefore
// the acceptance tests for every backend.
//
// # What the digest covers
//
// The digest is sha256 over the canonical JSON of the plan's MEANING: the
// environment and bundle, the live basis it was computed against, whether the
// config was identical, and each finding's code, class, section and subject.
// It excludes the digest itself, ComputedAt (two computations of one plan
// happen at two times), and each finding's Detail — prose, which may be worded
// differently by two forge versions without the plan meaning anything
// different. Everything Detail says is derived from fields the digest covers
// (the bundle pins its images; the basis names what is live).
