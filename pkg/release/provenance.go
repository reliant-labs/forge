// Provenance is WHERE a release or a bundle came from: the source tree, the
// checkout it was built in, and the forge that rendered it. It is shared by
// releases (the images) and bundles (the config), so "images from main@abc,
// config from feat-x@def, dirty" is two values of one type.
//
// # Claims and checkable facts
//
// What a CLIENT may claim and what a SERVER can establish are kept apart, and
// every reader must keep them apart too:
//
//   - Commit is checkable against the repository.
//   - Tree is checkable when Dirty is false: a clean tree's hash IS the
//     commit's tree, so a clean claim can be verified without trusting the
//     client.
//   - Branch, Worktree and Dirty are claims. They are evidence and are
//     rendered as such ("reported by forge"), never used as authority.
//   - Ancestry ("is this commit on main") is never a field here. It changes
//     over time — a branch is merged, a force-push orphans a commit — so it
//     cannot sit on an immutable record. A backend derives it.
//
// Release.Git predates this type and is kept, filled from it (see
// [Release.SetProvenance]), so ledgers written before Provenance existed
// still decode and readers that only know Git keep working.
