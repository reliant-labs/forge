// Diamonds: two paths to one parent, and the invariant that lives only at the
// join.
//
// Every value this package synthesizes satisfies its own constraint by
// construction, and a foreign key is no exception — the seeder picks a real
// parent row for every edge. But it picks EACH EDGE INDEPENDENTLY, and some
// schemas carry a constraint that no single edge expresses:
//
//	orders.patient_id                                  -> patients.id
//	orders.prescription_id -> prescriptions.patient_id -> patients.id
//
// Both columns hold valid references. Nothing in either constraint says they
// have to name the SAME patient, and independent picks do not: measured on a
// real generated app, 18 of 20 seeded orders named one patient directly and a
// different one through their prescription. The run then handed four fan-out
// units those order ids as "verification data" — rows a CORRECT implementation
// of the rule they were building must reject.
//
// The seeder was never BROKEN here. It was unaware: it had no concept of a
// transitive constraint, so it never asked whether two routes to one node
// agree.
//
// This is general, not one domain's quirk: Order->Customer + Order->Address->
// Customer, Invoice->Account + Invoice->Subscription->Account. Anywhere a
// table references two parents and one parent also reaches the other, the two
// routes are an unstated invariant.
//
// # Derivable → derive. Decision → declare.
//
// That a diamond EXISTS is derivable from the foreign-key graph alone, so
// forge finds it with no help. WHICH parent is authoritative is a fact about
// the DOMAIN — forge guessing it would be forge making an architecture choice
// on the user's behalf, and it would be wrong for real schemas (an order can
// ship to an address belonging to someone else). So forge does not guess, and
// it does not shrug either: it REFUSES to seed, and the refusal is a runbook
// naming the relationship, the options, and the literal statement to paste.
//
// # Where the declaration lives, and why
//
// On the foreign-key constraint, as a postgres COMMENT:
//
//	COMMENT ON CONSTRAINT orders_patient_id_fkey ON orders IS
//	    'forge:ref derived-from=prescription_id';
//
// Three candidates were weighed:
//
//   - db/seeds/vocab.yaml — closest to the seeder, but it is the wrong SCOPE
//     twice over. That overlay says in its own doc that it supplies vocabulary
//     only and that referential machinery is never overridable. And "an
//     order's patient is determined by its prescription" is not a seeding
//     fact: validation and the ApproveOrder rule need the same sentence.
//   - A forge: annotation in the migration text — next to the FK, but
//     migrations are append-only history, so the annotation would have to be
//     located across the whole set, and forge would have to parse migration
//     SQL. It reads the applied CATALOG today, so this would introduce a
//     second source of truth for the same fact.
//   - COMMENT ON CONSTRAINT — plain SQL, applied by the migration that
//     creates the reference, and landing in pg_description where forge's
//     EXISTING introspection can read it (schemadef.ForeignKey.Comment). No
//     forge-specific file, no forge-specific parser, no second source of
//     truth; psql \d+ and every other tool see it too.
//
// The third wins on every axis that matters: the fact sits where a reader
// looking at the reference would find it, and forge reads it from the one
// place it already reads the schema.
//
// # The vocabulary
//
//	forge:ref derived-from=<column>   the route leaving by <column> is
//	                                  authoritative; seed THIS column from it
//	forge:ref authoritative           this column is the truth; the other edge
//	                                  is constrained to agree with it
//	forge:ref independent             the two are unrelated facts; seed each
//	                                  on its own and say nothing further
//
// # When forge cannot honour a declaration
//
// A UNIQUE foreign-key column is a 1-1 relationship: the seeder hands it a
// DISTINCT parent per row on purpose, so neither resolution can touch it —
// deriving it, or narrowing it into a bucket, would put two rows on one parent
// and abort the INSERT. Such a declaration is refused with its own reason
// rather than honoured into a failed transaction.
//
// `authoritative` also narrows the authoritative column itself, to parents
// that HAVE a partner on the other edge: a parent with none cannot satisfy the
// declaration on any row. That narrowing is real (the column ends up ranging
// over "patients who have a prescription") and is stated here rather than
// discovered in the data.
//
// # Why the derivation cannot loop
//
// A derived column reads other columns, so termination is a real question.
// BuildPlan force-nulls edges until a full topological order exists, so the
// foreign-key graph MINUS the force-null edges — the only edges a route may
// use — is a DAG. A loop would need A to reach B and B to reach A in that DAG.
// maxDiamondPath is carried through the walk anyway as a structural backstop:
// past it, derivation degrades to the independent pick rather than recursing.

// maxDiamondPath bounds the indirect-route search and the derivation walk. A
// diamond three or four hops deep is still a diamond, but the search runs over
// the foreign-key graph, which can be dense; the bound keeps the scan cheap
// and the report readable. Shares maxFKDepth's rationale and value.

// query, few enough to stay readable.

// statement, not an inference about the domain. A row must always name its
// parent directly; it may exist with no value at all on the other route, and a
// fact that is permitted to be absent cannot be the one that determines a
// column which never is. There is no reading of such a schema under which the
// optional edge is authoritative — `derived-from` would have to invent a
// parent for every row whose route is NULL.
//
// This stays inside "derivable → derive. decision → declare." (see the file
// header): it fires only where the two routes are not symmetric, and a genuine
// decision needs symmetry — two required routes, both always present, either
// of which a domain could reasonably call the truth. Those still refuse. So do
// two optional ones: absent on both sides is no asymmetry to read.
//
// It is deliberately STRUCTURAL. It does not look at column names and knows
// nothing about tenancy, ownership or scope; a schema with no such column
// benefits identically. That matters because the alternative — recognizing
// `company_id`/`tenant_id`/`org_id` — would put a domain concept back into a
// package that removed one on purpose.
//
