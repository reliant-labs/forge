// What forge invents, and what it refuses to invent.
//
// Everything in this file derives a value from something the author DECLARED:
// the column's canonical type, its CHECK vocabulary, its pattern, its length
// and range bounds, its NOT NULL, and the referential structure around it. No
// branch reads the column's NAME to decide what the column MEANS.
//
// It used to. `price` / `amount` / `*_cents` were money, `last4` was a payment
// card, `date_of_birth` was a birthdate, `role` drew from {admin, member,
// viewer, editor, owner}, `name` drew from a company pool unless sibling
// columns made the table look person-ish. Every one of those is a DECISION —
// what noun belongs in a column — and a decision is not in the schema, so
// forge cannot derive it. Guessing produced values that were right for the
// vocabulary the guess was written against and silently wrong everywhere
// else: a `users(id UUID)` table whose row 0 was pinned to the non-UUID
// `dev-user-001` failed the INSERT and, because the seed is one transaction,
// took the entire dataset down with it.
//
// The declaration surface for what forge cannot derive is
// db/seeds/vocab.yaml. See doc.go.
//
// What an undeclared column gets instead is a value that is type-correct,
// deterministic, inside every declared constraint — and SELF-EVIDENTLY
// synthetic (see SyntheticStringPrefix). That last property is not cosmetic.
// Realistic-looking fake data is what let `["enterprise","free"]` sit in a
// clinic's order line items and pass its CHECK, and what let `dev-user-001`
// read like an id right up until it met a UUID column. Data that announces
// itself as invented can be told apart from data the app produced, at a
// glance, without a query.

// SyntheticStringPrefix is the stamp every string forge INVENTS carries.
//
// It is what makes a seeded database readable at a glance: a value carrying
// the stamp was made up by the generator, and a value without it came from
// somewhere that knows the domain — a CHECK vocabulary, db/seeds/vocab.yaml,
// or db/seeds/custom. Exported so that assertions about synthesized data
// derive the set they check from the emitter's own mark instead of a copied
// list of literals that dies silently the day the emitter changes.

// The AVALANCHE step is not decoration. FNV-1a's low bit is a LINEAR
// function of its input — the prime is odd, so the multiply preserves bit

// to two columns of the same row, so the relationship between two boolean
// columns was fixed by the parity of their NAMES: opposite parity meant
// they NEVER agreed, same parity meant they never differed, at every salt
// and every row. A products table could only ever seed two of the four
// (active, requires_prescription) combinations, leaving the app path that
