// Composite UNIQUE — distinctness that no single column carries.
//
// The planner already models the one-column form: a UNIQUE data column gets a
// distinct value per row (constraints.go, assignUnique), and a UNIQUE foreign
// key gets a distinct PARENT per row (the uniqueFK bijection in plan.go). Both
// read the same fact off the same index. Neither of them looks at
//
//	UNIQUE (org_id, user_id)
//
// which is not a statement about org_id, and not a statement about user_id: it
// is a statement about the PAIR. Each column may — must — repeat; only the
// tuple may not. Drawing the two independently is exactly what the seeder did,
// and on the real control-plane schema it collided by row six:
//
//	duplicate key value violates unique constraint "org_memberships_org_id_user_id_key"
//
// which, the seed being one transaction, took every other table down with it.
//
// # The assignment
//
// A composite key is an ODOMETER. Give each member a supply of distinct values
// with a known size, order the members, and read row i off as a mixed-radix
// number: member 0 advances every row, member 1 every c0 rows, and so on. Two
// different row indices below the product of the sizes produce two different
// digit tuples, so the tuple is distinct BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by luck —
// the same guarantee the one-column paths give, generalized to k columns.
//
// Two properties of the reading are worth stating, because they are what keep
// it from being disruptive:
//
//   - Members are ordered by DESCENDING supply size, so the widest column is
//     the one that advances every row.
//   - A member whose stride has already reached the row target contributes a
//     digit that is CONSTANT over every row the plan writes. Such a member
//     carries no information, so it is not assigned at all — it keeps its
//     ordinary draw. On the common shape (two foreign keys, both parents at
//     least as numerous as the child's row target) exactly ONE column is
//     placed and the other keeps its natural scatter, which is precisely the
//     generalization of `uniqueFK`'s "child row i takes parent row i".
//
// # What counts as a supply
//
//   - A FOREIGN KEY member supplies its parent's rows: digit k means parent
//     row k. This is where a composite key differs most from a single-column
//     one — the members of `UNIQUE (org_id, user_id)` are usually BOTH
//     references, each of which repeats freely on its own, and the pair is
//     made distinct by moving one of them deterministically rather than by
//     making either column unique.
//   - A plain data member supplies the distinct values the single-column
//     machinery would give it (assignUnique): its CHECK/vocabulary members
//     drawn without replacement, or its per-row synthesized values. Calling
//     that code rather than restating it is what keeps one length model, one
//     pattern model and one probe.
//   - Anything else — a key member, a generated or array column, a column an
//     ordering or a discriminated union already places, a managed timestamp —
//     supplies nothing. It is left alone and counted as one, which is the
//     conservative accounting: an unassigned column may happen to vary, and
//     nothing here relies on it.
//
// # What is skipped, and what is refused
//
// Skipped in silence, because the constraint is already satisfied or cannot
// bind: a member that is itself distinct per row (a single-column UNIQUE, a
// UNIQUE foreign key, a key column), a member that is always NULL (a
// force-nulled cycle edge, a soft-delete marker — postgres never conflicts two
// NULLs), and a partial index whose predicate is false of every row this plan
// writes (partialIndexBinds, the same reading the one-column path uses).
//
// Refused loudly, in the two shapes the rest of the package already uses: a
// supply too small for the row target CAPS the table and says so, exactly as a
// one-column UNIQUE with a short vocabulary does; a constraint where NO member
// supplies anything gets the "forge cannot place its values" warning, ending
// in the same clause every other refusal here ends in.
