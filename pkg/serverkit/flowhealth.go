// flowhealth.go — the GET /flow-health endpoint.
//
// /flow-health is the APP-FLOW analogue of /readyz. /readyz answers "can this
// process serve traffic" (listener bound, deps reachable); /flow-health
// answers "is the end-to-end invariant this service OWNS actually holding"
// (e.g. "every Ready managed daemon is attached to the gateway"). The owning
// service is the only place that can assert it — it holds the state — so the
// assertion runs HERE, inside the service, and the result is exposed as a
// plain HTTP status:
//
//	200  every registered FlowCheck passed   (healthy)
//	503  at least one FlowCheck failed        (unhealthy)
//
// PUBLIC / NO-LEAK CONTRACT. The response body is STATUS-ONLY: per-check name +
// ok + a TERSE aggregate Summary ("2 daemons, 0 unattached"). It carries NO
// per-entity / per-user detail, so the endpoint is anonymous-safe and `forge
// smoke` can curl it with no creds. Per-entity detail belongs behind your own
// authenticated endpoint (or an internal-only port), never here.

// flowHealthResponse is the status-only JSON body of /flow-health. Additive:
// new fields may appear; existing keys keep their meaning.
type flowHealthResponse struct {
	Status string                  `json:"status"` // "healthy" | "unhealthy"

// non-sensitive aggregate — never per-entity detail.

// checks. Every check runs on each request (the assertion is cheap relative to
// the network round-trip and must reflect live state). The overall status is
// healthy iff every check passed; any failure yields 503 so a load balancer /
// `forge smoke` reads the break directly off the status code.
