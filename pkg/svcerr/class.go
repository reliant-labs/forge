// Class is fault attribution: WHO has to act on an error. It is a separate
// question from the Connect code, which says what the CLIENT is told.
//
// Observability is what consumes it. A log level, a Sentry event and an
// alert all mean "someone on our side must look at this", and an error the
// caller or user caused — a typo in a field, an expired invitation, a
// disconnected laptop, an empty wallet — is the system working correctly.
// Paging on those buried the real faults: in one measured week a product's
// ERROR stream was dominated by "no daemon connected for user" and "AI
// provider usage limit reached", none of which anyone on the server side
// could do anything about.
//
// Classify derives the class from the error itself; WithClass overrides it
// for the conditions the code cannot express.

// Classed is implemented by an error that states its own Class: a typed
// error whose every occurrence means the same thing ("this provider's
// subscription is out of credit") declares it once, on the type, instead of
// each return site wrapping it with WithClass. WithClass's wrapper is itself
// a Classed.

// Classify reports who has to act on err. In order:
//
//  1. nil is ClassNone.
//  2. The nearest explicit class on the chain wins — a WithClass marker, or
//     an error type implementing [Classed]. It is how an application states
//     what the code alone cannot — "the user's machine is offline" travels
//     as Unavailable, which by kind is a server fault.
//  3. A cancellation — context.Canceled, ErrCanceled, or a *connect.Error
//     with CodeCanceled — is ClassCanceled.
//  4. Otherwise the kind decides, through the same code the client receives
//     ([Code]). The client-fault kinds are ClassUser: InvalidArgument,
//     NotFound, AlreadyExists, PermissionDenied, Unauthenticated,
//     FailedPrecondition (and so InsufficientBalance and Expired),
//     OutOfRange, and ResourceExhausted (and so PlanLimit). Everything else
//     — Internal, Unknown, DataLoss, Unavailable, DeadlineExceeded, Aborted,
//     Unimplemented, and any error nothing recognised — is ClassServer.
//
// ResourceExhausted is a user class because forge's own sentinel means a
// caller's quota, rate limit or plan. When it is YOUR capacity that ran out
// — a connection pool, a disk — return Unavailable or Internal instead.
//
// Kind is read from the code because the code is what the client was told:
// a 4xx is the caller's to fix, so a log that disagreed with the response
// about whose fault it was would be its own bug. A 4xx that is really ours
// (a row that must exist and does not) is a wrong code, or a place for
// WithClass(err, ClassServer).
//
// # Behind a WithCause
//
// Steps 2 and 4 read the OUTER error of a [WithCause], exactly as the client
// does: a WithClass marker, a [Classed] type or a kind in the cause does not
// count. WithCause(Internal("charge failed"), notFoundFromBilling) is our
// fault — a dependency said not_found, and we answered internal — so it is
// ClassServer; an inner ClassUser marker must not silence it.
//
// Step 3 is the one exception, deliberately: it sees a cancellation anywhere,
// cause included. A context.Canceled is not a verdict someone chose; it is
// the fact that the caller went away, and it reaches handlers labelled
// however they label every repository failure —
// WithCause(Internal("list failed"), err) receives one each time a browser
// navigates away mid-query. Paging on those is the noise this exists to
// remove. The wire still reads the outer error.

// an RPC boundary.
//
// The marker lives in the error chain, so it survives wrapping
// (fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)) and Wrap/ToConnect in process. It does not
// cross a network boundary; a remote caller classifies by the code it

// inner one. A marker on a [WithCause] cause is not the error's class: the
// outer error decides.
