# Block until proxy.golang.org (and the checksum database) actually SERVE a
# just-pushed module version.
#
# ── The failure this exists to stop ───────────────────────────────────
#
# `git push --atomic` returns the instant GitHub has the tag. The Go module
# proxy has not heard of it yet. proxy.golang.org discovers a new version by
# polling the origin, and sum.golang.org only records a hash once the proxy
# has fetched the tree — so for a window measured in MINUTES after a
# successful release push, `go mod download github.com/reliant-labs/forge@vX.Y.Z`
# 404s for everyone on earth, including our own CI.
#
# That is exactly what has been happening to E2E Scaffold on every release
# commit. The job scaffolds a project that requires the version just tagged
# and runs `go mod tidy`, which asks the proxy for a tag the proxy does not
# have. It fails, for ~6 minutes, on a release that is completely correct.
#
# The cost is not the red X. It is that a release lane which is red on every
# single release teaches everyone to ignore it, which is precisely how a tag
# that is genuinely broken ships unnoticed. A check nobody believes is worse
# than no check — the same reasoning that widened the npm window in
# verify-npm-published.sh (#341), which this script deliberately mirrors.
#
# ── Why curl and not `go mod download` ────────────────────────────────
#
# `go mod download` is the operation we are waiting to become possible, so it
# looks like the obvious probe. It is the wrong one here, for a reason that
# bites on a developer laptop rather than in CI: GOPRIVATE / GONOSUMDB /
# GOFLAGS are routinely set in this workspace (the sibling repos are private),
# and any of them can make the go command bypass the proxy entirely and answer
# from the origin or a local cache. The probe would then report "ingested"
# while the PUBLIC proxy — the one CI and every user reads — still has
# nothing.
#
# forge is a PUBLIC module. Asking the public endpoints over plain HTTP is
# both the honest question and immune to whatever the local environment
# believes. release-forge.sh's immutable-version gate already talks to the
# proxy this way; this is the same technique pointed at the opposite question.
#
# ── Both endpoints, because they fail independently ───────────────────
#
# The proxy serving the .info is necessary but not sufficient. A default
# `go mod tidy` also consults sum.golang.org, and the sumdb records a hash
# only after the proxy has fetched and hashed the tree. Waiting on the proxy
# alone leaves a smaller but real window where resolution still fails with a
# checksum-database error, which reads as a SECURITY failure rather than a
# propagation delay and sends people looking in entirely the wrong place.
#
# ── The window, and the two outcomes ──────────────────────────────────
#
# ~10 minutes with capped exponential backoff, matching verify-npm-published.sh.
# The common case resolves in seconds and stays fast; the slow case must not
# hammer the endpoints. Observed ingestion has run past six minutes, so a
# window any tighter reintroduces the false red this script removes.
#
# On timeout the message must say WHICH state we are in, because the two have
# opposite remedies:
#
#   tagged but not yet ingested — the tag is pushed and visible on the origin.
#     Nothing is wrong; the proxy is late. WAIT and re-run. Do NOT delete and
#     re-cut the tag: proxy.golang.org is immutable and re-cutting at a new
#     commit burns the version permanently.
#
#   not reachable at all — the tag could not be confirmed on the origin
#     either, so the push may not have landed. That is a real problem and the
#     release is not complete.
#
# TESTING SEAMS. GOPROXY_WAIT_BASE / GOSUMDB_WAIT_BASE point the probes at a
# fixture server, and GOPROXY_WAIT_MAX_SECONDS / GOPROXY_WAIT_FIRST_DELAY /
# GOPROXY_WAIT_MAX_DELAY shrink the window so a test exercises the timeout
# path in milliseconds. Nothing else differs between CI and test.

Polls proxy.golang.org and sum.golang.org until both serve <module>@<version>,
or the window elapses.

  --module       module path, e.g. github.com/reliant-labs/forge
  --version      exact version, e.g. v0.1.30
  --tag-pushed   the tag push reported success; changes a timeout from
                 "not reachable" to "tagged but not yet ingested"
  --skip-sumdb   wait on the proxy only (for a module the sumdb never sees)

Environment (testing seams):
  GOPROXY_WAIT_BASE         proxy base URL     (default: https://proxy.golang.org)
  GOSUMDB_WAIT_BASE         sumdb base URL     (default: https://sum.golang.org)
  GOPROXY_WAIT_MAX_SECONDS  total window, seconds (default: 600)
  GOPROXY_WAIT_FIRST_DELAY  first backoff delay, seconds (default: 5)
  GOPROXY_WAIT_MAX_DELAY    cap on any single sleep, seconds (default: 30)
