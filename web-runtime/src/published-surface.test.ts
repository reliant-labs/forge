//
// The publish contract: what a consumer resolves, and what it must never be
// able to resolve.
//
// This package used to publish its TypeScript SOURCES — `types` pointed at
// src/index.ts — which made every consumer typecheck this package's internals
// against its own React. That is not a version-pinning bug to chase; it is
// structural. A React 18 consumer (Expo SDK 52 pins 18.3) compiling sources
// written against @types/react 19 got errors in files it never rendered:
//
//   providers.tsx: 'RuntimeErrorBoundary' cannot be used as a JSX component
//   resource.tsx:  Type '0n' is not assignable to type 'ReactNode'
//
// Now it publishes dist/. Every consumer gets .d.ts, which their tsconfig's
// skipLibCheck does not re-typecheck, and whose React references are resolved
// in THEIR program against THEIR React. This test pins the three properties
// that keeps true.
//
// `pretest` builds dist/ before vitest runs, so these assertions always read
// a current build rather than whatever happened to be on disk.
