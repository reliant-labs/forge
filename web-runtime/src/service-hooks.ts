// Part of @reliant-labs/web-runtime — the web twin of forge/pkg.
//
// The React Query wrapper machinery behind forge's generated per-service hook
// files (`src/hooks/<svc>-service-hooks_gen.ts`).
//
// WHAT WAS HERE BEFORE. Each generated file re-emitted the same three things
// per RPC: a query-key entry, a useQuery or useMutation wrapper, and — for
// mutations — the entity-scoped invalidateQueries plus the onSuccess
// composition, with the reasoning for each re-inlined as comments. A
// five-service project rendered five copies of machinery that differed only in
// RPC names and message types. This module IS that machinery, written once.
// The generated file keeps exactly what varies per RPC: the name, the request
// schema, the response type, query-vs-mutation, and the entity scope.
//
// WHY A SUBPATH AND NOT THE BARREL. This module imports @tanstack/react-query.
// Every browser frontend forge scaffolds depends on it — but the barrel is
// also what a consumer imports for interceptors and errors alone, and
// anchoring React Query there would make a non-React consumer resolve a
// package it never installed. Same reasoning as ./mock-transport and ./otel:
// an engine with its own dependency footprint gets its own entry point, and
// React Query is an OPTIONAL peer.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not emit error toasts — the
// app-wide MutationCache in src/lib/query-client.ts is the single error-toast
// chokepoint, and pages that render errors inline pass
// `meta: { silenceErrorToast: true }`. It never defaults success-side UX
// either: "CreateOrder succeeded" leaks RPC names into the UI, so the toast /
// redirect / inline confirmation stays the call site's via options.onSuccess.
